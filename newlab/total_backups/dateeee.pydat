The City of Calgary required testing of a full-scale prototype panel for both static and dynamic responses. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to determine the boundary conditions to be imposed on one edge of the prototype panel during the tests to simulate the presence of the other two in the actual structure. The FEA was also used to determine the critical (independent) snow and wind loading cases. The analyses and the testing procedures for the full-scale instrumented panel are described. The panel withstood both full factored loads without damage. The methods for manufacturing and assembling the canopy and roofs are also described. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

VThe least-squares fitting minimizes the squares sum of error-of-fit in predefined measures. By the geometric fitting, the error distances are defined with the orthogonal, or shortest, distances from the given points to the geometric feature to be fitted. For the geometric fitting of circle/sphere/ellipse/hyperbola/parabola, simple and robust nonparametric algorithms are proposed. These are based on the coordinate description of the corresponding point on the geometric feature for the given point, where the connecting line of the two points is the shortest path from the given point to the geometric feature to be fitted. 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.

VThe main objective of this study is to provide a parametric evaluation of the pull-out work of smooth steel fibers embedded in cementitious matrices. The various parameters controlling the behavior of the bond stress versus slip relationship are analyzed; their effects on the entire pull-out load versus slip response and the corresponding pull-out energy up to full debonding and/or up to total pull-out are investigated. Also discussed are the effects of the fiber geometric parameters such as fiber diameter, length, and aspect ratio. Finally, a brief section addresses the relation between pull-out work and the critical strain energy release rate Gc, a fracture mechanics variable, which can be calculated if the P- curve is known.

VSafety concerns and a lack of test data are responsible for the current upper limit of 100 psi on the square root of the concrete compressive strength for use in calculating tension development and lap splice lengths. Based on recent research on the lap splice strength of reinforcing bars in high-strength concrete, modifications to current design criteria are formulated that will allow removal of the limit on the square root of the compressive strength, ensure adequate ductility and bond, and improve the overall safety of the tension development and lap splice criteria in ACI 318-95 for concrete with strengths above 10,000 psi. The result of the analyses used to develop the new design criteria indicate that increasing lap splice length, without providing transverse reinforcement, does not provide an adequate level of ductility in high-strength concrete members. Adequate ductility can be achieved by using a minimum splice length, as defined by ACI 318-95 for beams without transverse reinforcement, plus a minimum quantity of transverse reinforcement over the tension development/lap splice length with an area equal to 50% of the area of the bars being developed/spliced.

VSafety concerns and a lack of test data on the bond strength of deformed reinforcing bars embedded in high-strength concrete are reasons why the ACI 318 Building Code has imposed an arbitrary limit of 10,000 psi (69 MPa) in calculating the tension development length and the tension lap-splice length. This limitation was first introduced in the 1989 edition of ACI 318. In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this limitation and develop provisions for its removal, a two-phase investigation was carried out at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This paper provides a compute summary of the experimental investigations conducted in both phases of the project. Phase I of the investigation was supported by the Portland Cement Association, while Phase II was supported by the National Science Foundation. During the two phases, 70 beam specimens with tension reinforcement splices were tested. The parameters studied included: Bar size, length and deformation type of the reinforcing bars, amount of transverse reinforcement over the splice length, casting position, and concrete compressive strength. Results of the investigation are used to discuss observed differences in how reinforcing bars in tension develop in normal and high-strength concretes (HSCs), to develop hypotheses to explain these differences, and to suggest conditions for removal of the current concrete compressive strength limitation of the ACI 318 Building Code, which applies to the calculation of tension development length and tension splice length. Development of code language provisions for removal of the current limitation, is discussed elsewhere. In this paper, HSC is defined as concrete with compressive strength exceeding 10,000 psi (69 MPa).

VBecause of the lack of test data, ACI-318-89 building code requirements imposed an arbitrary upper limit of 10,000 psi (69 MPa) on specified compressive strength of concrete fc prime that may be used in calculating tension development length and tension splice length. A research study was conducted to evaluate the bond performance of reinforcing bars embedded in high-strength concrete. Twelve beam splice specimens using No. 11 reinforcing bars and concrete with compressive strengths exceeding 14,000 psi (97 MPa) were tested. The effect of several variables on bond capacity in high-strength concrete is discussed and a failure hypothesis explaining the observed behavior during the experimental phase of the study is presented. Additionally, it is concluded that the current trend in ACI of making the splice length longer to compensate for having small cover and spacing may not be an effective approach. A better approach could be to provide a minimum amount of transverse reinforcement.

VCharacteristics of different types of bond and thier function in cement based matrices with fibre reinforcement are discussed. The assumptions about bond in a number of existing theoretical models predicting behaviour of fibre reinforced cements are reviewed and a graphical interpretation in used to demonstrate the influences of the main characteristics of bond on the failure of the composite. A critical survey of the methods for testing of bond is carried out and is supplemented by a discussion of the information about bond between cement matrices and different types of fibres currently available. The conclusions point out clearly the need for a continued research into the bond phenomena and indicate areas in which further work is recommended.

VA graphical interpretation and analysis of pull-out tests is developed to indicate combined effects of factors such as the tensile strength of the fibre and the bond characteristics of the fibre-matrix interfaces on the mode of pull-out failure. In addition to the critical embedment length the significance of two other embedment lengths is shown. One is the minimum length at which a tensile failure of a reinforcing element is not preceded by debonding and the other one is the maximum embedment length at which a complete debonding occurs instantaneously. The graphical analysis is applied to a typical pull-out test result and quantitative values of the ultimate elastic shear bond and the frictional bond are obtained.

VThis paper summarizes the results of over 100 pure shear tests on reinforced concrete panels. The ACI approach for predicting shear strength as the sum of a diagonal cracking load and a 45-degree truss model predicts the strength of these panels poorly, with an average experimental-over-predicted shear strength ratio of 1.40 with a coefficient of variation of 46.7%. Based on a subset of these experiments, an expressive but relatively complex analysis method called the modified compression field theory (MCFT) was developed in the 1980s that is able to predict full load deformation relationships. This theory can predict the shear strength of these panels with an average shear strength ratio of 1.01 and a coefficient of variation (COV) of only 12.2%. This paper presents a new simplified analysis method that can predict the strength of these panels in a method suitable for ????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬???Â¨Â¦a??a??Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥????Â¨Â¦????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦a??????????aâ\u201a¬|????????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦aâ\u201a¬??????|????Â¡Â¥????Â¨Â¦????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦a??????????aâ\u201a¬|??Â¨Â¦a????Â¡Ã£back of the envelope????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬???Â¨Â¦a??a??Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥????Â¨Â¦????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦a??????????aâ\u201a¬|????????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦aâ\u201a¬?????-??????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬????? calculations.

VAn experimental investigation was performed to study the bond between deformed bars and self-consolidating concrete (SCC) through pullout tests on short cylindrical anchorages. The specimens were cast with plain and fiber-reinforced (1% of steel fibers) SCC to evaluate the confinement given by fibers. In the case of plain concrete, tests were performed with and without lateral pressure. To assess size effects, three bar diameters were considered, and the geometry of the specimens was adopted to assume a constant ratio between the specimen diameter/bar diameter (= 9) and the bonded length/bar diameter (-2). The results were analyzed by a limit analysis model to evaluate the ultimate bond capacity and concrete cover at which the splitting/pullout failure transition is observed. SCC exhibits higher bond strength and, compared to ordinary concrete, requires larger concrete cover to attain pullout failure.

VThis paper investigates the effectiveness of transition zone densification on the fiber-cement paste system. By controlling the water: cement (w:c) ratio and the condensed silica fume content, environmental scanning electron microscopy studies confirm that transition zone densification can be achieved in all brass, steel, and polyethylene fiber-cement systems. However, single fiber pullout tests indicate that densification only enhances the brass-cement paste interface bond strength and not the other systems. Further microscopy investigation of the surface of fibers peeled off from a composite fracture surface and of the groove left by the fiber on the cement paste suggests that bond failure for the brass-cement system is of a cohesive type, whereas bond failure for the other two systems is of an adhesive type. It is concluded that the transition zone densification technique should be effective in fiber-cement systems in which bond strength is controlled by cohesive failure of the transition zone material.

VIn this paper, the effect of silica fume on the bond characteristics of steel fiber in matrix of reactive powder concrete (RPC), including bond strength, pullout energy, etc., are presented. The experimental results on steel fiber pullout test of different conditions are reported. Various silica fume contents ranging from 0% to 40% are used in the mix proportions. Fiber pullout tests are conducted to measure the bond characteristics of steel fiber from RPC matrix. It is found that the incorporation of silica fume can effectively enhance the fiber-matrix interfacial properties, especially in fiber pullout energy. It is also concluded that in terms of the bond characteristics, the optimal silica fume content is between 20% and 30%, given the conditions of the experimental program. The microstructural observation confirms the findings on the interfacial-toughening mechanism drawn from the fiber pullout test results. 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VIt has long been recognized, in cement chemistry, that two types of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) exist in cement-based materials, but less is known about how the two types of C-S-H affect the mechanical properties. By means of nanoindentation tests on nondegraded and calcium leached cement paste, the paper confirms the existence of two types of C-S-H, and investigates the distinct role played by the two phases on the elastic properties of cement-based materials. It is found that (1) high-density C-S-H are mechanically less affected by calcium leaching than low density C-S-H, and (2) the volume fractions occupied by the two phases in the C-S-H matrix are not affected by calcium leaching. The nanoindentation results also provide quantitative evidence, suggesting that the elastic properties of the C-S-H phase are intrinsic material properties that do not depend on mix proportions of cement-based materials. The material properties and volume fractions are used in a novel two-step homogenization model, that predicts the macroscopic elastic properties of cement pastes with high accuracy. Combined with advanced physical chemistry models that allow, for a given w/c ratio, determination of the volume fractions of the two types of C-S-H, the model can be applied to any cement paste, with or without Portlandite, Clinker, and so on. In particular, from an application of the model to decalcified cement pastes, it is shown that that the decalcification of the C-S-H phase is the primary source of the macroscopic elastic modulus degradation, that dominates over the effect of the dissolution of Portlandite in cement-based material systems. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

VIn steel fiber-reinforced composites materials, fiber and matrix are bonded together through a weak interface. The study of this interfacial behavior is important for understanding the mechanical behavior of such composites. Moreover, with the outcome of new composites materials with improved mechanical properties and advanced cement matrices, such in the case of steel fiber reinforced self-compacting concrete, the study of the fiber/matrix interface assumes a new interest. In the present work, experimental results of both straight and hooked-end steel fibers pullout tests on a self-compacting concrete medium are presented and discussed. Emphasis is given to the accurate acquirement of the pullout load versus end-slip relationship. The influence of fiber embedded length and orientation on the fiber pullout behavior is studied. Additionally, the separate assessment of the distinct bond mechanisms is performed, by isolating the adherence bond from the mechanical bond provided by the hook. Finally, analytical bond-slip relationships are obtained by back-analysis procedure with an interfacial cohesive model. 2010 ASCE.

VCriteria recommended by ACI Committee 408 on development and lap splice length design for straight reinforcing bars in tension are presented in code format and compared with those in ACI 318-05, Building Code Recommendations for Structural Concrete. The recommended criteria produce designs with improved reliability compared to those in ACI 318. Development lengths are longer than those in ACI 318 for conditions of low cover or confinement, but shorter for bars with higher degrees of confinement, provided by added cover and transverse reinforcement and wider spacing between bars, and for normalweight concretes with strengths between 10,000 and 16,000 psi (70 and 110 MPa).

VThe testing and analysis of 83 beam-splice specimens containing bars with relative rib areas ranging from 0.65 to 0.140 are described. Concretes containing two different coarse aggregates are used to evaluate the effect of aggregate properties on bond strength. Sixty specimens contain uncoated bars with confining transverse reinforcement. Thirteen specimens contain uncoated bars without confining reinforcement, and 10 specimens contain epoxy-coated bars, nine without confining reinforcement and one with confining reinforcement. The tests are analyzed to determine the effect of relative rib area and bar diameter on the increase in bond strength provided by confining reinforcement. The tests also provide a preliminary indication of the effect of high relative rib area on the splice strength of epoxy-coated bars.

VAn expression for the bond force at failures is developed by conducting statistical analyses of 133 splice and development specimens in which the bars are not confined by transverse reinforcement and 166 specimens in which the bars are confined by transverse reinforcement. The expression is developed as a function of concrete strength, cover, bar spacing, development/splice length, transverse reinforcement, and the geometric properties of the developed/spliced bars. Using the results, design criteria are formulated that incorporate a reliability-based strength reduction factor that allows the calculation of a single value for both development and splice length for given material properties and member geometry.

VIn this paper a calculation method is explained to predict the total number of fibres crossing a rectangular section. The largest part of the paper deals with the theoretical calculation of an orientation factor. The orientation factor is defined here as the average length of the projection on the longitudinal axis of all fibres crossing a section, divided by the fibre length. Once the orientation factor is found, a simple calculation gives the number of fibres crossing a crack. Since the proposed approach is to a large extent new, there is a need for verification with test results. For this reason a fibre counting was done on 107 Rilem beam specimens, involving different fibre types. The comparison with the calculated number of fibres shows that the model provides good predictions of the number of fibres crossing a section. 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VThe fracture process of steel fiber/cementitious matrix composites has been studied using a single-fiber pullout test that permits detailed measurements of the load-crack opening displacement relationship during fiber debonding and unloading. Using a suitable analytical model, the interfacial fracture energy and interfacial sliding friction have been calculated for composites incorporating steel fibers with cement paste or mortar matrices. Comparison of theoretical debonding curves with the experimental data show that the model accurately represents the fiber debonding process, except for a decrease in interfacial sliding friction due to wear of matrix asperities at the interface. Differences between the calculated interfacial properties of several specimens are associated with changes in the interfacial microstructure.

VProgressive fiber debonding in steel fiber/cementitious matrix composites has been studied using a single fiber pullout test that permits simultaneous measurements of the load versus crack opening displacement relationship and Moire interferometry fringe patterns. Analysis of Moire interferometry patterns allows the fiber axial and interfacial shear stresses to be calculated along the entire fiber length. The interfacial shear stress distribution along the debonded length of the fiber indicates a steep decrease in shear stress with interfacial slip, from 6 to 1 MPa for 7 m of fiber slip and a crack opening displacement of 22 m. These results suggest that improvements in the toughness of cement-based composites could be achieved by developing materials in which the decrease in shear stress is less severe.

VThis paper summarizes an investigation undertaken to study the bond characteristics of high-strength steel reinforcement bars commercially known as microcomposite, multistructural, formable steel (MMFX). The objective of the investigation is to examine the applicability of the ACI 318-02 equation and a current proposed equation by Zuo and Darwin on bond behavior of steel reinforcement to the concrete member. The experimental program included two phases. The first phase of the experimental program consisted of testing four beam-end specimens reinforced with MMFX steel bars, whereas the second phase included testing eight beam-splice specimens reinforced with MMFX steel bars. The selected four factors considered in this study were bar size, level of confinement, bonded length, and bar cast position. The bond behavior of the MMFX steel bars was found to be similar to that of conventional Grade 420 MPa (60 ksi) steel up to the proportional limit of 550 MPa (80 ksi). The bond strength of the MMFX significantly changes as the tensile stresses developed in the bar exceed the proportional limit. The test results indicated that both the ACI 318-02 equation and the current proposed equation by Zuo and Darwin on bond are adequate and resulted in conservative prediction at low stress levels up to 550 MPa (80 ksi). At high stress levels, however, the prediction using both equations is unconservative due to the nonlinear behavior of the MMFX stress-strain relationship. Based on the limited number of specimens considered in this study, modification to both the ACI 318-02 equation and the Zuo and Darwin equation is proposed to predict the bond forces beyond the proportional limit for MMFX steel bars.

VThis paper presents an equation to calculate the required development/ splice length of reinforcing bars. The equation is based on previous studies on bond between normal-strength concrete (NSC) and high-strength concrete (HSC) and reinforcing bars. The previous proposed equation to predict the bond strength has been modified to account for the effect of rib properties of reinforcing bars. Also, a new parameter to account for the effect of transverse reinforcement (TR) on bond strength has been introduced. The comparison between the results of 284 available tests in cases of NSC and HSC shows that the new proposed model correlates very well with the test results. Using the proposed equation for bond strength, an equation to calculate the development/splice length has been derived. The equation requires providing some amounts of TR along the development/splice length. By providing the calculated value of TR, the proposed development/splice length would result in adequate ductility for beams with spliced bars. The proposed procedure correlates well with the test results. Copyright &copy; 2005, American Concrete Institute.

VThis paper presents the second part of a study on bond. It reports on the influence of several parameters on bond in splices. The parameters covered are concrete strength, splice length, concrete cover, ratios between side cover, bottom cover, and the spacing between the spliced bars, rib face angle of the reinforcing bar, and admixtures in the concrete mix. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, an analytical equation was developed to calculate the bond strength of splices in normal strength concrete. The mean value of test/calculated bond strength for the proposed equation is 1.007 with a standard deviation of 0.084. These values indicate a significant improvement in the calculation of the bond strength when compared to other proposed equations. The second stage of the research involved tests on twenty two beams made of high-strength concrete (HSC). In each beam, the tensile steel was spliced in the constant moment zone. The test strengths are compared with the calculated values. Good correlation between calculated and test strengths of splices in the case of HSC is found.

VThe paper presents the first part of a study on bond. It reports the research conducted on bond strength of short length specimens (Local Bond Strength) in normal strength and high-strength concrete (HSC). For normal strength concrete, using the test results available in the literature, Tepfers' partly cracked thick cylinder theory is modified to account for the variation of the bursting angle and the tensile plastic deformation of the concrete. The study of local bond in HSC included tests of forty-five short length specimens using two types of bars with different rib face angles. For different ranges of concrete strength, a relationship for bond strength normalized with respect to the tensile strength of concrete is obtained. The normalized bond strength increased with the compressive strength of concrete. The bond strength of the bars with rib face angles between 23 and 27 deg is smaller than that of bars with rib face angles between 40 to 47 deg.

VTo increase the crack bridging capacity of concretes and mortars, fibers are often added to cement-based matrices. As a result, the fracture energy of a fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is the sum of the cohesive forces of the matrix and of the pullout resistance given by the fibers crossing the crack. In the case of fibers randomly inclined with respect to crack surfaces, the so-called frictional snubbing effect must be added to the previous contributions, if the energy released during crack growth has to be computed. Of course, snubbing forces are not present when fibers are perfectly orthogonal to crack surfaces. As the classical formulas are not always effective in the evaluation of snubbing phenomenon, a cohesive interface model is here proposed for a more precise definition of the frictional snubbing forces. The model is able to predict adequately the experimental results obtained by pulling out steel fibers at different inclinations angles from cement-based matrices. By analyzing fibers with different bond properties, the proposed model can be also used to define the crack bridging capacity of both bonded and unbonded steel fibers. Moreover, it seems to suggest a more simplified approach for the definition of the postcracking response of FRC. 2008 ASCE.

VA probabilistic model for predicting the expected value and the variance of the postcracking tensile strength of fiber reinforced concrete is presented. Fibers are assumed to occur as a spatial Poisson process. Orientation of the fibers is assumed to be of three types: 1) randomly orientated in space; 2) randomly orientated within a prescribed plane; and 3) fibers all aligned along an axis. Analytical strength predictions are compared with existing strength data and the model assumptions are critically discussed.

VThe nature and properties of the resistance to fibre-matrix interfacial debonding in composites composed of ductile fibres in a brittle or elastic matrix can be determined using the single-fibre pull-out test. The results of such tests on cementitious matrix specimens indicate a non-linear relationship between the debonding and/or pull-out load and the embedded length of the fibre. Several of the theories developed to explain the debonding process and enable estimation of the parameters representing the debonding resistance through an analysis of pull-out test results are reviewed in this first of a two-part paper. The application of these theories to experimental data for steel fibre-cementitious matrix pull-out specimens is examined in the second part.

VSignificant recent advancements in cement-based, fiber-reinforced composite materials have stretched the bounds of concrete into the realm of ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC). The durability of a commercially available UHPC was independently evaluated through six standardized durability tests and the results are reported herein.

VThe influence of mortar fineness and several adhesive additives on the pullout load-versus-slip response of steel fibers is described. Ten different mortar mixtures were prepared. Parameters included two types of sand and four types of additives that were expected to influence the interfacial zone between the fiber and the matrix. The fibers were either smooth round, hooked round, or triangular twisted. All mixtures had the same sand-cement ratio and water-cementitious ratio. The two sands were Ottawa silica sands, one identified as normal sand 50 to 70 (that is, passing ASTM sieve 50 and retained on sieve 70, with an average particle size of 270 microns), and the other identified as microsand 270 (with an average particle size of approximately 14 microns). The four additives were fly ash (as a cement replacement), metakaolin, latex, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Control mixtures without any additive were also tested. The specimens prepared were half dogbone-shaped specimens with a single embedded fiber. At least four specimens were prepared and tested for each parameter. Pullout load versus global slip curves were recorded, and an average curve was generated for comparison purposes. Conclusions are drawn related to the influence of test parameters on the pullout load versus slip response; frictional, adhesive, or mechanical bond; and pullout energy.

VKnowledge of the mechanical properties, i.e. strength, stiffness and deformation capacity, of cementitious materials at any arbitrary time is fundamental for operations such as removal of formwork, prestressing or cracking control. This paper presents a study of the evolution of indexes related to hydration and their correlation to the development of the mechanical properties for an Ultra-High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC). The hydration kinetics was determined using semi-adiabatic heat of hydration tests, and the mechanical properties were investigated experimentally at several ages between 3 and 365days and then described with models originally developed for conventional concretes. Models and experiments were in good agreement. Furthermore, it was observed that for the UHPFRC, the rate of development of mechanical properties was highest for the secant modulus, followed by the compressive and then the tensile strength. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

VThe primary objective of the research reported in this paper was to evaluate the effect of steel fiber reinforcement on the bond strength and ductility of the mode of bond failure of tension lap splices anchored in high-strength concrete (HSC) test specimens. What makes this study significant is that ACI Committee 408 (Bond and Development) is working on proposing recommendations specifying minimum transverse reinforcement on anchored reinforcement in HSC (f prime c &gt; 70 MPa) to provide ductility to the mode of failure. To meet the objective, 12 full-scale HSC beam specimens were tested. Each beam was designed with bars spliced in a constant moment region at midspan. The variables were bar size db = 20, 25, or 32 mm, and the volume fraction of steel fibers added in the splice region Vf = 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0%. Test results indicated that the use of steel fibers in the splice region increased the bond strength and the ductility of the mode of failure of the beam specimens. The increase in bond strength with high fiber content exceeded 3 root f prime c, the maximum increase in bond strength of a reinforced concrete beam that could be achieved by using transverse reinforcement in the splice region.

VTwo research programs were recently conducted to assess the effect of confinement provided for tension lap splices anchored in high-strength concrete (HSC) beam specimens on bond strength of the splices and mode of failure of the beams. In each program, 12 full-scale beams were tested and three bar sizes were checked (20, 25, and 32 mm). Beams of the same bar size in the two programs were identical except for the type of confinement used in the splice region. In one program, steel fibers of different volume fractions were used. In the second program, transverse reinforcement was placed in various amounts. Test results of both programs indicated positive effects of the provided confinement on the bond strength of the tension lap splices and on the mode of failure. The objective of the paper was to use the results of the two programs to perform a correlation between the amount of transverse reinforcement placed in the splice region and the volume fraction of fiber reinforcement added in the splice region during the casting procedure needed to improve the bond capacity and the ductility of the mode of failure of tension lap splices embedded in high-strength concrete.

VBased on experimental data of tension lap splices confined with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets in normal and high strength concrete (HSC) specimens, a new FRP confinement parameter, Ktr,f was recommended. It accounts for the increase in bond strength due to the presence of FRP sheets. In this paper, a correlation is presented between the confining effects of FRP flexible sheets, transverse reinforcement, and steel fibers to improve the bond capacity and ductility of the mode of failure of tension lap splices. The correlation is based on research programs conducted at the American University of Beirut in recent years using identical specimens except for the confinement method used: FRP sheets, transverse steel stirrups, or steel fibers. Other variables included the amount of confinement provided and concrete strength. Analysis of test results indicated that an equivalent improvement in bond strength of tension lap splices in normal and high strength concrete specimens is provided by an amount of FRP sheets corresponding to a Ktr,j value of 2.5, or an amount of transverse reinforcement corresponding to K tr of 1.0db. For HSC specimens, an amount of steel fibers corresponding to a volume fraction of 1% would provide an equivalent improvement in bond strength. &copy; ASCE.

VThis paper presents the results of two phases of a research program conducted at the American University of Beirut (AUB) to examine the effect of confinement provided by fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets on the bond strength of tension lap splices anchored in high-strength concrete (HSC) beams. Ten beams with a nominal concrete strength of 68.95 MPa (10 ksi) were tested in positive bending. Each beam was reinforced on the tension side with three 20 mm (No. 6) bars spliced at midspan in a constant moment region. U-shaped FRP sheets were used to externally confine the splice region. The main test variables were the types of FRP sheets: glass or carbon (GFRP or CFRP), the FRP configuration in the splice region (one strip, two strips, or a continuous strip), and the number of FRP layers confining the splice region (one layer or two layers). Except for the epoxy adhesive, no additional anchorage mechanism or bonding procedure was applied for the FRP sheets on the concrete beam. Test results indicated that GFRP and CFRP wraps were effective in improving the bond strength of the lap splices and the ductility of the mode of failure. The experimental results were used to propose a new FRP confinement parameter k tr,f that accounts for the presence of FRP sheets confining tension lap splices in HSC beams. This parameter was calculated based on: area, spacing and ultimate strength of the FRP sheets, and the number and diameter of steel bars being developed.

VDuctile fiber-reinforced cement-based composites (DFRCCs) are being investigated for new design as well as retrofitting of structures in seismic regions. DFRCC is highly ductile and is characterized by strain-hardening in tension to strains over 3% and by unique cyclic loading behavior. To accurately predict the structural performance of DFRCC components under cyclic and seismic loading, a robust constitutive model is needed for structural-scale simulations. In this paper, a constitutive model based on total strain is proposed and applied to simulate structural component tests. The model in particular captures DFRCC????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬???Â¨Â¦a??a??Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥????Â¨Â¦????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦a??????????aâ\u201a¬|????????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????????Â¡Â¥??aâ\u201a¬???aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦????Â¡Â¥????Â¨Â¦????Â¨Â¦??Â¨Â¦a??????????aâ\u201a¬|????????Â¡Â¥??Â¨Â¦a??????aâ\u201a¬?????Â¨Â¦s unique reversed cyclic loading behavior. The simulation results show that the implemented model is robust and reasonably accurate in simulating DFRCC structural components reinforced with steel and fiber-reinforced polymer bars.

VThis paper presents the results of an analytical study undertaken to evaluate the bond strength of reinforcing bars embedded in plain and fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC). The analysis was conducted using a numerical solution scheme of the bond problem in which an experimentally derived local bond stress-slip response of reinforcing bars, applicable for pullout and splitting-type bond failure, was incorporated. The analytical model accurately reproduced experimental results of bond strength for reinforcing bars embedded in plain unconfined concrete with different ratios of concrete cover-to-bar diameter c/db, and having development/splice lengths of up to 60db. Also, the analytical predictions showed excellent agreement with limited experimental data of bond strength of reinforcing bars embedded in steel FRC. For plain unconfined concrete, normalization of bond strength relative to f prime c1/4, covering both NSC and HSC, leads to a more accurate prediction of experimental data and a more consistent trend in the bond results as compared to f prime c1/2. The use of fiber reinforcement significantly increases the development/splice strength and considerably enhances the ductility of bond failure. The increase in bond strength acquired using steel fibers may reach levels substantially larger than the maximum limit stipulated in the ACI building code for ordinary transverse reinforcement. Based on the results of the analysis, supported with experimental data, a design equation is proposed to evaluate the development/splice strength of reinforcing bars embedded in steel FRC.

VA numerical model for the dowel action of reinforcement bars crossing cracks in concrete is developed for finite element analysis of concrete structures. The beam on elastic foundation theory is used to derive the dowel force-displacement relationship, which is expressed in a smeared form in terms of dowel stress and strain in order to be compatible with the smeared crack and smeared reinforcement models commonly used in finite element analysis. This dowel action model is incorporated in a finite element program that employs secant stiffness formulation and a displacement controlled iteration scheme for nonlinear analysis. Using the finite element program, the nonlinear behaviors of several reinforced concrete beams tested by others are analyzed well into the post-peak range. The beams are analyzed first with the dowel action neglected and then again with the dowel action incorporated. It is found that in certain cases, the dowel action can have significant effects on the shear strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams and that the analytical results generally agree better with the experimental values when the dowel action is taken into account.

VThe systematic development of ultra high performance concretes (UHPC) is presented and the durability and the performance of these concretes when exposed to long-term aggressive action, is examined. The first step for the development of UHPC consists of selecting a suitable fine aggregate mix by optimizing the particle size distribution in the fine aggregate mix range with regard to the water demand. The subsequent optimization of the mortar comprises of the assessment of the mortar in a hardened state, apart from testing the fresh mortar with the aid of rheometric measurements. In the final development step, the concrete is optimized on the basis off the resulting fresh and hardened concrete properties. The interaction between cement and superplasticizer greatly influences the rheological behavior of fresh mortars. UHPC are distinguished by their extraordinary high strength and high density of the cement paste matrix that counteracts the action of aggregate media.

VThrough recent studies on the fracture mechanics of concrete, the existence of a fracture process zone has been indentified, and governing mechanisms are clarified. Although analytical prediction of crack growth phenomena under static, mode I loading has been made possible, the mechanism of fatigue crack growth under cyclic loading has not been studied. In the present study an analytical model of fatigue crack growth in concrete is proposed in order to identify its governing mechanism. Consideration is based on the tension-softening behaviour of concrete under cyclic load. Low-cycle fatigue crack growth tests have been carried out in which the distribution of crack opening displacement was measured by the laser speckle method. Experimental results are compared with analytical predictions by the proposed model in order to discuss the mechanism of fatigue crack growth.

VThe object of the present work was to study the influences that processing may have on the pullout resistance of a steel fiber from a normal cementitious matrix, consisting of portland cement binder cast as paste or mortars with varying sand content. In order to determine the mechanisms by which the processing affects the pull-out resistance, the nature of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) was evaluated simultaneously by microhardness testing and characterization of its microstructure by SEM. It was found that processing of the matrix and modifications in its composition by changing the sand content had a considerable influence on the steel fiber-matrix average bond, which was increased by a factor of two. The influences are due to changes in the interfacial microstructure and the content of sand. In pastes, the interfacial microstructure seems to be the dominant mechanism controlling bond, and processing which leads to densening results in higher average bond. The influences in mortars are more complex; average bond is less sensitive to processing and is more influenced by the sand content.

VThe nanometer-scale structure of cement paste, which is dominated by the colloidal-scale porosity within the C-S-H gel phase, has a controlling effect on concrete properties but is difficult to study due to its delicate structure and lack of long-range order. Here we present results from three experimental techniques that are particularly suited to analyzing disordered nanoporous materials: small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), weight and length changes during equilibrium drying, and nanoindentation. Particular attention is paid to differences between pastes of different ages and cured at different temperatures. The SANS and equilibrium drying results indicate that hydration of cement paste at 20 &deg;C forms a low-density (LD) C-S-H gel structure with a range of gel pore sizes and a relatively low packing fraction of solid particles. This fine structure may persist indefinitely under saturated conditions. However, if the paste is dried or is cured at elevated temperatures (60 &deg;C or greater) the structure collapses toward a denser (less porous) and more stable configuration with fewer large gel pores, resulting in a greater amount of capillary porosity. Nanoindentation measurements of pastes cured at different temperatures demonstrate in all cases the existence of two C-S-H structures with different characteristic values of the indentation modulus. The average value of the modulus of the LD C-S-H is the same for all pastes tested to date, and a micromechanical analysis indicates that this value corresponds to the denser and more stable configuration of LD C-S-H. The experimental results presented here are interpreted in terms of a previously proposed quantitative "colloid" model of C-S-H gel, resulting in an improved understanding of the microstructural changes associated with drying and heat curing. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

VReactive powder concrete (RPC) is a novel cement-based composite material with ultra-high strength. Embedding a certain amount of short steel fibers in the matrix can improve the RPC's toughness and overcome the disadvantage of high brittleness. In this paper, a number of direct uniaxial tension tests have been carried out with '8-shape' RPC200 specimens. The bond-slip process, mesoscopic structural variation and mechanical characteristics of a fiber pullout of the matrix have been investigated using the real-time SEM loading system and CCD observation techniques. The influence of the volume of embedded short steel fibers in matrix on the mesoscopic morphology of attachments on the surface of a pulled individual fiber, the initial cracking force, the ultimate pullout force, interfacial bond strength and the pullout rupture energy have been analyzed. A general formulation relating these quantities to the volume of fibers in matrix has been proposed. The components comprising the interfacial bond strength have been outlined. In addition, the contribution that fibers make to enhance and toughen the reactive powder concrete has been discussed. It is shown that there exists an optimal threshold of fiber volume v, opt = 1.5% at which the bond performance of a fiber pullout of RPC behaves best. 2007 Science in China Press.

VIn an asbestos qualitative analysis, the major methods are X-ray diffraction analysis and visual observation by operators using a microscope. In particular, a major method of visual evaluation is dispersion staining. In the usual visual observation process, the operators check the asbestos fibers in the view of the microscope and count the number of asbestos fibers. The method presented here attempts to detect asbestos fibers in the images taken by a microscope. The dispersion staining method identifies asbestos fibers with color dispersion from an immersion liquid combined with polarization. The presented method employs color changes of asbestos fibers associated with polarization. Specifically, candidate asbestos fibers are identified using the changes of dispersion colors and also position-matching between two images. The performance of the method has been evaluated by comparing its results with the results obtained by a human expert.

VThis paper describes the results of single-fiber pullout tests under various loading rates ranging from the static to the seismic level. Investigation of the loading rate effect on single-fiber pullout behavior provides a basis to better understand the effect of strain rate on the tensile properties of fiber-reinforced cement composites. Two types of high-strength deformed steel fibers (hooked and twisted fibers) known to have slip-hardening behavior under static pullout loading are evaluated. Experimental results reveal that the pullout response of twisted steel fibers shows rate sensitivity that is dependent on the compressive strength of the matrix. On the other hand, high-strength hooked fibers did not show rate sensitivity under pullout for the various matrixes tested. The test results also showed the pullout energy of twisted fibers increases with the matrix compressive strength and can be up to five times that of hooked fibers.

VIn this paper the behavior of concrete subjected to flexural fatigue loading is studied. Notched concrete beams were tested in a three-point bending configuration. Specimens were subjected to quasi-static cyclic and constant amplitude fatigue loading. The cyclic tests were performed by unloading the specimen at different points in the postpeak part of the quasi-static loading response. Low cycle, high amplitude fatigue tests were performed to failure using four different load ranges. The crack mouth opening displacement was continuously monitored throughout the loading process. Crack propagation caused by quasi-static and fatigue loads is described in terms of fracture mechanics. It is shown that the crack propagation in the postpeak part of the quasi-static load response is predicted using the critical value of the mode I stress intensity factor (KIC). The ultimate deformation of the specimen during the fatigue test is compared with that from the quasi-static test; it is demonstrated that the quasi-static deformation is insufficient as a fatigue failure criterion. It is observed that crack growth owing to constant-amplitude fatigue loading comprises two phases: a deceleration stage when there is a decrease in crack growth rate with increasing crack length, followed by an acceleration stage where the rate of crack growth increases at a steady rate. The crack length where the rate of crack growth changes from deceleration to acceleration is shown to be equal to the crack length at the peak load of the quasi-static response. Analytical expressions for crack growth in the deceleration and acceleration stages are developed, wherein the expressions for crack growth rate in the deceleration stage are developed using the R-curve concept, and the acceleration stage is shown to follow the Paris law. It is observed that the crack length at failure for constant amplitude fatigue loading is comparable to that of the corresponding load in the postpeak part of the quasi-static response. Finally, a fracture-based fatigue failure criterion is proposed.

VWith the increasing number of applications in practice, the demand for standardised test methods and design rules for Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) arises. Test methods need to be practical, which means that they have to be relatively cheap and simple to carry out. Design models should be easy to use and reliable. This paper presents a procedure to develop a post-cracking material relation for SFRC by means of inverse analysis. It shows that mean experimental results from three-point bending tests can be simulated with high accuracy using a bilinear stress-crack width relation. After determining the correct procedure to calculate the characteristic values, material safety factors are proposed dependent on the scatter in the post-cracking behaviour. Finally, a material relation is proposed that can be used for structural design purposes.

VThe results of an extensive experimental investigation of the deterioration of steel fiber reinforced concrete due to fiber corrosion is presented. About 1200 specimens were tested. Two parallel test programs were conducted: one dealt with the effect of corrosion on steel fiber reinforced mortar specimens, and the other dealt with the effects of using precorroded fibers in mortar specimens. Different exposure periods with typical 3 days, cycling in 3.5 percent standard sodium-chloride solution and in laboratory air, respectively, were used with different solution temperatures. All experimental results seem to indicate that after a certain degree of corrosion has occurred, strength and toughness decrease with an increase in the degree of corrosion and that these mechanical properties are primarily affected by the reduction in minimum fiber diameter.

VSteel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) is a new material allowing innovative projects for concrete structures. Such structures are designed using assumptions on the material fabric. Checking these assumptions requires, according to recommendations, coring and mechanical testing of samples. Non-destructive assessment, if validated, would provide an interesting alternative, making the checking process easier, quicker and less expensive. Blind tests in laboratory compare electrical resistivity measurements obtained with a four-probes square device, to visual analysis during pouring. After having defined a measurement process, the representativity of electrical resistivity values is assessed by analysis of measurements on eight slabs. Electrical resistivity allows the identification of a high or low resistivity axis, which gives the local orientation of steel fibres. The calculation of electrical anisotropy gives an indication of the "intensity of fibres orientation" in each area. In this article, the complete analysis process is detailed on two slabs which have been casted according to two different fibres distributions. These tests confirm the ability of electrical resistivity method to provide data on steel fibres within concrete, via a non-destructive way. &copy; 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VConsidering the probabilistic distributions of fibers in ring-type steel fiber reinforced concrete, the orientation factor and the number of ring-type steel fibers crossing the failure plane were theoretically derived as a function of fiber geometry, specimen dimensions, and fiber volume fraction. A total number of 24 specimens were tested incorporating different fiber types, specimen geometry, and fiber volume fractions of 0.2% and 0.4%: 5 beams and 5 panels containing straight steel fibers; and 6 beams and 8 panels containing ring-type steel fibers. Measurements were made to assess the number of fibers at fractured surfaces of steel fiber reinforced concrete. The developed theoretical expressions reasonably predicted the orientation factor and the number of ring-type steel fibers at failure plane: the average and the standard deviation for the ratios of the test to theory were 1.03 and 0.26, respectively. Theoretical investigations and comparisons were made for the values of orientation factor and the number of fibers at failure plane for straight steel fibers and ring-type steel fibers. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The fatigue performance of plain concrete and FRC, as reported in the literature, is compared in order to quantify the influence of fibre inclusion on fatigue behaviour. Despite the conflicting information regarding the fatigue behaviour of concrete reported in the literature, the majority of researchers show that the inclusion of fibres can benefit the fatigue performance of concrete. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

VThe mechanical behavior of brittle matrix composites is strongly affected by the bridging of cracks by fibers. In random fiber composites, fibers can lie at an angle to the crack plane. Under such conditions, the bridging stress for a certain crack opening is governed by various micromechanisms including fiber debonding, fiber bending and rupture as well as matrix spalling. While fiber debonding has been widely investigated, the coupled fiber bending/matrix spalling mechanism has received little attention. In this paper, the fiber bending/matrix spalling mechanism is analyzed by treating the fiber as a beam bent on an elastic foundation with variable stiffness and the possibility of spalling. The foundation stiffness and spalling criterion are derived from a finite element analysis. The bridging stress due to bending alone as well as the total bridging stress are then obtained for the case with brittle fibers. Through this analysis, the effect of various microstructural parameters (such as fiber and matrix moduli, matrix spalling strain and fiber/matrix interfacial friction) on the behavior of random fiber composites can be studied. Prediction of maximum bridging stress for inclined fibers based on the present model is shown to be in good agreement with experimental results.

VSteel fiber is the most common type of fiber reinforcement in cementitious materials. The reinforcement efficiency, in terms of maximum crack bridging force and total energy absorption during fiber pullout, is a function of many parameters including the properties of fiber, matrix, and interface as well as fiber size, volume fraction, geometry, and distribution. In this investigation, we focus on the effect of fiber yield strength on reinforcement efficiency. Fiber pullout specimens are fabricated with fibers of different yield strengths. Because cracks in a concrete member may intersect fibers at different angles, pullout tests are carried out with the fiber inclined at 0, 30, and 60. The experimental results indicate the existence of an optimal fiber yield strength for the maximization of pullout load and pullout work. Inspection of the pullout curves as well as microscopic studies show that a higher fiber yield strength will result in more severe matrix spalling around the fiber exit point, thus limiting the further improvement in reinforcement efficiency. The results confirm the qualitative trend predicted by an existing theoretical model and indicate that the fiber yield strength is an important parameter that should not be overlooked in the design of fiber reinforced cementitious composites.

VTheoretical models of mechanical properties of fiber reinforced cementitious composites require assumptions of fiber-cement interfacial behavior. In this paper, strength-based and fracture-based fiber debonding criteria are reviewed. To determine whether interfacial debonding is governed by the bond strength or critical energy release rate of the fiber-matrix interphase, fiber pull-out experiments were conducted using steel and brass wires of various diameters. The bond properties, including effective bond strength and frictional stress, were interpreted through a theoretical model of fiber pull-out. It was found that, for the material systems tested, interfacial debonding is dominated by frictional stress which is independent of the fiber diameters. Therefore, the debond mode of these material systems is categorized as strength-based. In general, the debond mode is a material characteristic and is dependent on the specific fiber and matrix types. In order to precisely predict the mechanical response of a fiber reinforced cementitious composite, it is necessary to determine the debond mode for a particular material system following the methodology proposed in this paper.

VIn an experimental investigation of synthetic fibre pull-out at an angle, it was generally observed that the force and energy of fibre pull-out increase with the inclination angle, but such increases are limited by the strength of the cement matrix at high angles due to matrix spalling. Studies were also conducted on the effects of fibre bundling and surface treatment on the pull-out behaviour. It is suggested that for effective use of the reinforcing fibres, fibre bundling should be minimized and the fibre/matrix bond property should be controlled.

VA new crack bridging model accounting for slip-hardening interfacial shear stress is derived for randomly oriented discontinuous flexible fibers in cement-based composites, based on a micromechanics analysis of single fiber pull-out. The complete composite bridging stress versus crack opening curve ([sigma]B - [delta] relation) and associated fracture energy are theoretically determined. A micromechanics-based criterion which governs the existence of post-debonding rising branch of the [sigma]B - [delta] curve is obtained. Implications of the present model on various composite properties, including uniaxial tensile strength, flexural strength, ductility and critical fiber volume fraction for strain-hardening, are discussed together with an example of a 2% polyethylene fiber reinforced cement composite. It is found that the present model can very well describe the slip-hardening behavior during fiber pull-out which originates from fiber surface abrasion at fiber/matrix interface. In addition, the new model predicts accurately the enhanced toughness in terms of both ultimate tensile strain and fracture energy of the composite and resolves the deficiency of constant interface shear stress model in predicting the crack opening and ultimate strain, which are critical for material design of pseudo strain hardening engineered cementitious composites (ECCs).

VThe crack-bridging behavior of inclined steel fiber in cementitious composites was discussed at meso-scale. The embedded part of the fiber in the cementitious composites was assumed to act as a bar. while the part of the fiber outside the matrix was simplified into two configurations, cantilever beam for elastic fiber and plastic joint for elastoplastic fiber. The Naaman's shear lag model was adopted for the axial control relation. A concept of lateral effective load-bearing area was adopted to simplify the description of the effects of local spalling or crushing in matrix around the fiber. An analytical debonding and pullout model for high modulus inclined fiber was constructed. Results show that the model can preliminarily simulate the elastoplastic pullout behavior of inclined high modulus crack-bridging fiber.

VThe macroscopic shear strength contribution of concrete in reinforced concrete members is supported by dowel action, aggregate interlocking across tension-shear cracks and the tensile stress field that becomes mobilised in concrete through reinforcement concrete bond. The mechanics of this relationship are explored in this paper for the benefit of improved understanding of the degradation of shear strength in reinforced concrete as a function of imposed deformation demand. The mathematical formulation uses the non-linear smeared crack/smeared reinforcement approach to consider plane stress states in reinforced concrete elements. The critical modelling assumption in assessing the concrete contribution to shear resistance was the representation of force transfer from bar to concrete, which requires establishing equilibrium both at crack locations as well as in a global sense. The significance of this modelling approach on the overall shear strength was evaluated by the comparison of computed results with those obtained from the conventional model, wherein concrete participation is lumped artificially under the so-called [`]tension-stiffening' property. From this comparison the parametric dependence of tension stiffening on bar diameter, crack spacing and bond properties is illustrated. Through the mathematical formulation it was possible to identify and highlight the effect that compression softening of the concrete struts has on the contribution of the web reinforcement to shear resistance, which represents yet another source of globally observed strength degradation. The proposed model was verified by comparison with experimental results and was subsequently used for parametric investigation of the associated design problem.

VThe type and amount of microcracking in normal weight concrete were determined by the direct observation of the slices cut from the necked prismatic specimens subjected to static and repeated tensile loads. It was found from the results of observation under static tensile loading that bond cracks increased almost linearly with increasing load and that mortar cracks developed extensively at about 100% of the ultimate load. The results under repeated tensile loading indicated that the repetitive nature of loading merely conduced to a slight increase in the total amount of internal microcracking. The relations between these findings and two features of the tensile fatigue previously reported were discussed.

VThe frictional nature of fiber pullout is a major reinforcing mechanism in brittle matrix composites. The objective of present work is to develop an interface failure model for use as a closing pressure formulation. A fracture mechanics model for the debonding of a fiber from a cementitious matrix is used to calculate the stiffness degradation due to propagation of a stable debonding zone. A formulation based on the growth of a mode II crack along an elastic-perfectly plastic 1-D interface is used. The crack growth criterion is defined using the strain energy release rate of a partially debonded interface. It is assumed that the fracture toughness of the interface increases as a function of the debonded length in the form an an R-Curve approach. In addition, a frictional shear stress of constant magnitude acts over the debonded length. The R-Curve parameters are obtained by numerical solution of the resulting differential equations. The load-slip response is obtained from the R-Curves, and a parametric study of fiber type, length, and interface properties are conducted. Results are compared with a finite element model based on Coulomb frictional models.

VThis paper investigates the shear strength of beams and one-way slabs without stirrups based on the opening of a critical shear crack. The shear-carrying mechanisms after the development of this crack are investigated. On this basis, a rational model is developed to estimate the shear strength of members without shear reinforcement. The proposed model is based on an estimate of the crack width in the critical shear region, taking also into account the roughness of the crack and the compressive strength of concrete. The proposed model is shown to properly describe a large set of available test data. A simplified method adopted by the Swiss code for structural concrete (SIA 262) is also introduced. Comparisons with other codes of practice are finally presented, with a highlight on the main differences between them.

VThis study describes the basis for an innovative concept related to building better and more durable concrete bridge decks. The decks are assumed to be supported by beams of any structural material (for example, steel, concrete, and wood). The typical deck is made with high-performance fiber-reinforced cement composites (HPFRCC) and reinforced with only one layer of transverse (normal to the supporting beam axis) bottom reinforcing bars (steel or fiber-reinforced polymer [FRP]) for positive moment resistance. Thus, the reinforcement is as far away as possible from the top surface of the deck and protected from intrusion of corrosive agents. The HPFRCC is designed to: 1) balance part of the negative moment; 2) allow the development of an effective plastic hinge mechanism, with hinges forming at supports and in spans, under ultimate loading; and 3) keep crack widths extremely small under service conditions. A dramatically higher durability is expected. When the bottom reinforcement is prestressed, beneficial secondary moments are created at the supports, helping to improve overall performance. A brief summary of test results and analytical modeling is given in this paper.

VA comprehensive experimental program on pullout and pullthrough tests of steel fibers from a cement-based matrix is described. Emphasis is placed on the accurate measurements of the pullout load versus end-slip response. Parameters included three different types of fibers (smooth, deformed, and hooked), three different mortar matrixes with low, medium, and high strengths, one cement-based slurry matrix, and additives such as latex, fly ash, and microsilica. The medium from which the fiber was pulled out included a control mortar mix without fibers, mortar mixes with 1, 2, and 3 percent fibers by volume, and a SIFCON matrix containing about 11 percent fibers by volume. For smooth fibers, five different diameters and three different embedment lengths were investigated. Experimental pullout load versus slip curves are needed to derive typical bond shear stress versus slip curves considered to be a property of the interface.

VThe tensile response of fiber reinforced cement (FRC) composites can be generally classified in two distinct categories depending on their behavior after first cracking, namely, either strain-hardening or strain-softening. Within the strain-softening category, one can distinguish between deflection-hardening and deflection-softening behavior. Several standard tests (ASTM, JCI, RILEM) are available to assess the characteristics of mostly strain-softening FRC composites through bending tests, but no standard test is currently available to characterize strain-hardening response in tension. Such composites have been described as high performance FRC or HPFRC composites. In this paper a proposal is put forth to characterize the response of strain-hardening FRC composites based on the results of direct tensile tests. The classification is based on several parameters which include a minimum value of elastic modulus, a minimum value of peak strain after first cracking, and the tensile strength level. While one of the key obstacles remains, that is, to develop a realistic and meaningful tensile test standard, some requirements on minimum specimen size, fiber size and aggregate size are also suggested. RILEM 2006.

The equation is based on a nonlinear regression analysis of test results of beams with lap splices and reflects the effect of length, cover, spacing, bar diameter, concrete strength, and transverse reinforcement on the strength of anchored bars. Design recommendations are proposed and compared with current provisions for development splice length.

VPerformance enhancement due to microfibers is well known. However, fracture processes that lead to strain hardening behavior in microfiber reinforced composites are not well understood. Crack growth resistance behavior of mortar reinforced with steel microfibers and polypropylene microfibers was investigated in-situ during load application. The polypropylene fibers were inter-ground in the cement mill to enhance the fiber/matrix interfacial frictional stress. A more homogeneous fiber distribution was observed in the inter-ground polypropylene composites compared to the steel microfiber reinforced composites. In steel microfiber reinforced composites the dominant toughening mechanisms were multiple microcracking and successive debonding along the fiber/matrix interface. Fiber pullout, the dominant mechanism in conventional macrofiber reinforced composites was rarely observed. In-situ observation of crack/fiber interaction in the inter-ground polymer fibers also revealed multiple microcracking along the length of the fibers followed by fiber pullout. 2006 RILEM.

VA comprehensive study has been undertaken to investigate the ability of AC-impedance spectroscopy (AC-IS) to non-destructively monitor the fiber dispersion of conductive fiber-reinforced cement-based materials. Previous work showed that AC-IS effectively monitors various fiber dispersion issues in lab-scale steel fiber-reinforced specimens. In this part of the study, AC-IS was used to study fiber orientation in an industrial-scale pre-cast concrete beam. A conventional method-image analysis (IA)-was used to verify the results of AC-IS measurements. The results of AC-IS and IA were found to match very well in experimental uncertainty. Splitting tensile tests and bending tests were conducted on the parts of the beam to study the effects of fiber orientation on the mechanical performance. The results of the mechanical tests also confirmed the results of AC-IS with splitting tensile strengths increasing as the alignment of fibers increased. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VThe results of six bending, shear and torsion tests on steel fiber reinforced rectangular concrete beams without web reinforcement are presented and discussed. The variable parameter is longitudinal steel at bottom only. The top reinforcement, aspect ratio and volume fraction of steel fibers kept constant for all the beams. From the tests conducted, it was found that the torsional strength is independent of longitudinal reinforcement. The experimental results were compared with the modes of failure proposed by Mansur and Mansur and Paramasivam under combined bending, shear and torsion for SFRC beams and Dr. V. Ramakrishnan and Vijayarangan for beams without web reinforcement under combined torsion and bending. It is shown that experimental results compare favorably with the theoretical predictions.

VInterfacial and microfailure properties of the modified steel, carbon, and glass fiber-cement composites were investigated using the electro-pullout test under tensile and compressive tests with acoustic emission (AE). The hand-sanded steel composite exhibited higher interfacial shear strength than the untreated and even neoalkoxy zirconate (Zr) treated steel fiber composites. This might be due to the enhanced mechanical interlocking, compared to possible hydrogen or covalent bonds. During the curing process, the contact resistivity decreased rapidly at the initial stage and then leveled off. Compared to the untreated case, the contact resistivity of either Zr-treated or hand-sanded steel fiber composites increased to infinity at the latter stage. The number of AE signals of hand-sanded steel fiber composite was much greater than those of the untreated and Zr-treated cases because of many interlayer failure signals. AE waveforms for pullout and frictional signals of the hand-sanded composite are larger than those of the untreated case. Under compressive loading for dual matrix composite, AE energy was much higher and the waveform was larger than those under tensile loading, because of their brittle but well-enduring ceramic nature against compressive stress. Vertical multicrack exhibits for the glass-fiber composite under tensile test, whereas buckling failure appeared under compressive loading. The electro-micromechanical technique with AE can be used as an efficient nondestructive method to evaluate the interfacial and microfailure mechanisms for conductive fiber-cement composites of the brittle and nontransparent type. 2001 Elsevier Science.

VThis paper describes a study of the factors influencing the pull-out force of stainless steel wires embedded in Portland cement mortar. The first part provides a theoretical elastic analysis of the pull-out force in terms of the misfit between wire and matrix, the coefficient of friction at the wire-matrix interface and the elastic constants of the materials. The resulting equation shows that the behavior is greatly influenced by the Poisson contraction of the wire during pull-out. Since the elastic modulus of the mortar is only five or six times smaller than that of the wire this can lead to a large reduction in stress-transfer across the wire-matrix interface and a corresponding reaction in pull-out force. In general the pull-out force is extremely sensitive to the wire-matrix misfit. The second part deals with an experimental study of the effect of surface finish of the wire and the effect of an externally applied confining pressure. The paper concludes with a discussion of the significance of this non-elastic behavior in the practical performance of fiber reinforced mortars and the role of mechanical deformations of the fibers.

VIn the present study, we show that high-resolution 29Si and 27Al magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be a powerful tool for analyzing actual concrete mixes. The influence of the amount of silica fume and of the type of cement in high-performance concrete (HPC), as well as the influence of the type of silica fume and of the granular packing in ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) were investigated. Significant effects on the amount and shape of C-S-H, on the incorporation of aluminum in the C-S-H structure, and on the distribution of aluminum-containing hydrates were observed. Nuclear magnetic relaxation of protons was also performed and it showed the fractal feature of the pore size distribution in UHPC and the higher amount of larger pores in HPC. The microstructure of the surface of these same formulations leached by mineral water for up to 1 year exhibits slight modifications.

VSteel fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) is being used in a variety of structural applications, yet there is still considerable debate how to express and evaluate flexural toughness for design purposes. This is holding back the material's development as a permanent structural material. Existing beam and slab test methods have problems with variability or their application in structural design. Furthermore, existing models of SFRC flexural behaviour do not fully capture what happens at the cracked section in terms of the fibre-matrix interactions. Typical of these approaches is the modelling of the tension zone from single fibre pull-out tests, which is problematic in measurement of the load-displacement relationship, the interaction of groups of fibres and the extensive testing required to cover all permutations of fibre geometry. An alternative approach is proposed where the average pull-out response of the fibres bridging the cracked zone is inferred from flexural beam tests. The characteristic load versus crack-mouth opening displacement behaviour for a particular fibre concrete then forms part of the stress and strain/displacement profile in a flexural analysis to predict moment capacity in a design calculation. The model is explained together with its validation by comparing the predicted load-displacement response for a range of fibre volumes in sprayed and cast SFRC. It is concluded that the analysis of beam load/deflection curves to infer the fibre pull-out response is a viable approach. It offers a promising solution to the need for a flexural design model combined with a practical method of characterizing the tensile contribution of steel fibres. RILEM 2006.

VRausch space truss theory (1925) is the earliest theory to predict the torsional response of RC members subjected to pure torsion. Softened truss theory proposed by Hsu considering the softening effect of concrete fairly estimates the torsional strength of the members under pure torsion. These theories consider the member to be a cracked one, so that the truss action activates. This assumption reduces the initial torsional stiffness of the cross-section. However the model proposed by Hsu considering the softening effect of concrete fairly estimates the ultimate torque carrying capacity of the RC member. Fiber reinforced concrete is a better option in the construction of blast resistant and earthquake resistant structures. Relatively little research has been reported on the analytical studies of SFRC members subjected to pure torsion. Thus in this paper an attempt has been made to develop an analytical model for predicting the torque-twist response of SFRC members subjected to pure torsional loads considering the softening effect of concrete. Experimental validation was also presented in this paper. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

VA systematic experimental research was carried out to investigate the mechanical properties of high-performance concrete (HPC). A total of 91 plate specimens were tested in four different loading conditions including uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, biaxial compression, and tension compression with the help of a closed-loop testing machine. Uniaxial and biaxial complete stressstrain curves were obtained under a strain control loading scheme. Based on the stochastic process theory, the average curves and standard deviation curves were obtained for uniaxial loading conditions. The rehardening of concrete after having entered the softening stage was observed in this experiment. The ultimate strength envelopes in both stress and strain space were developed through parameter identification of the complete stress-strain curves. This research laid a foundation for further research on the multiaxial constitutive law of concrete. Copyright 2008, American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved,.

VDevelopment of an ultra-high strength ductile concrete designated RPC (Reactive Powder Concrete), was made possible by the application of a certain number of basic principles relating to the composition, mixing and post-set heat curing of the concrete. RPC 200, which can be used under job site conditions similar to those for conventional high performance concretes, can be used in the construction of prestressed structures incorporating no passive reinforcement. RPC800 is suitable for precasting, and can achieve compressive strength values exceeding 600MPa. A value of 810MPa has been obtained with a mixture incorporating steel aggregate.

VThe traditional approach of codes of practice for estimating the punching strength of shear-reinforced flat slabs is based on the assumption that concrete carries a fraction of the applied load at ultimate while the rest of the load is carried by the shear reinforcement. Concrete contribution is usually estimated as a fraction of the punching strength of members without shear reinforcement. The ratio between the concrete contribution for members with and without shear reinforcement is usually assumed constant, independent of the amount of shear reinforcement, flexural reinforcement ratio, and bond conditions of the shear reinforcement. The limitations of such an approach are discussed in this paper and a new theoretical model, based on the critical shear crack theory, is presented to investigate the strength and ductility of shear-reinforced slabs. The proposed approach is based on a physical model and overcomes most limitations of current codes of practice. Its application to various punching shear reinforcement systems is also detailed in the paper and its results are compared to available test data.

VThere is currently a need to develop lightweight bridge deck systems with solid riding surfaces to replace the open-grid steel decks from moveable bridges. Open-grid steel decks present several problems, including poor rideability, high noise levels, susceptibility to fatigue damage, and high maintenance costs. There is a great opportunity to use advanced materials, such as ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), to develop new lightweight bridge deck systems. In this study, a low-profile UHPC deck system has been developed that satisfies the strength and serviceability requirements, addresses the concerns with open-grid steel decks, and meets the strict self-weight requirements for moveable bridges. The detailed experimental study shows that the proposed system has great potential to serve as an alternative to open-grid steel decks. Shear was the governing mode of failure in most of the specimens; however, it was not as abrupt and catastrophic as the commonly seen shear failure mode. Standard 180-degree hooks on both ends of the flexural reinforcement help avoid bond failure. The establishment of the development length of high-strength steel for UHPC, deck-deck connection, deck-girder connection, and fatigue performance still need to be investigated before the system is ready for implementation.

VThis paper describes the behavior of concrete bridge decks reinforced with newly developed high-performance (HP) steel that is characterized by its high sirength and enhanced corrosion-resistance in comparison with conventional ASTM A615-06 Grade 60 steel. The study presented herein included testing of three full-scale bridge decks with a span-depth ratio of 12.5. The first and second decks were constructed with the same reinforcement ratio using HP and Grade 60 steel, respectively. The third deck was reinforced with HP steel using 33% less reinforcement in an attempt to use its high strength. A nonlinear finite element model was used to predict the mode of failure and failure loads. Test results demonstrate that the use of HP steel at a reduced reinforcement ratio is viable as flexural reinforcement in concrete bridge decks. The paper also presents the test results of specially-designed specimens to study the effect of bending of HP steel bars on their tensile strength. &copy; 2008, American Concrete Institute.

VThe steel fiber-matrix properties of high-strength mortar (150 MPa), such as DSP (densified small particle), are obtained and compared to an ordinary strength mortar (40 MPa) using a specially designed fiber pullout apparatus. A new method for estimating the debonding energy of the interfacial zone from the experimental pullout curve is presented. The method is used to separate the areas under the pullout curve corresponding to debonding and friction. The predictions are compared to other methods in the literature. The proposed method seems to provide less variations in the results. The high-strength DSP mortar has significantly improved interfacial properties compared to ordinary strength mortar. These results are important in the understanding of the role of steel fibers in improving the tensile properties of high-strength, brittle, cement-matrix composites.

A specially designed single fiber pullout apparatus was used to provide a quantitative determination of interfacial properties that are relevant to toughening brittle materials through fiber reinforcement. The parameters investigated included a specially designed high strength cement based matrix called Densified Small Particles system (DSP), a conventional mortar matrix, fiber embeddment length, and the fiber volume fraction. The mediums from which the fiber was pulled included a control mortar mix without fibers, a mortar mix with 3, and 6 percent fibers by volume. The results indicate that: (1) The dense DSP matrix has significantly improved interfacial properties as compared to the conventional mortar matrix. (2) Increasing the fiber embeddment length and the fiber volume fraction in the cement matrix increase the peak pullout load and the pullout work. (3) The major bond mechanism in both systems is frictional sliding.

VAdvances in engineering the microstructure of cementitious composites have led to the development of fiber reinforced Ultra High Performance Concretes (UHPC). The scope of this paper is twofold, first to characterize the nano-mechanical properties of the phases governing the UHPC microstructure by means of a novel statistical nanoindentation technique; then to upscale those nanoscale properties, by means of continuum micromechanics, to the macroscopic scale of engineering applications. In particular, a combined investigation of nanoindentation, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) indicates that the fiber-matrix transition zone is relatively defect free. On this basis, a four-level multiscale model with defect free interfaces allows to accurately determine the composite stiffness from the measured nano-mechanical properties. Besides evidencing the dominant role of high density calcium silicate hydrates and the stiffening effect of residual clinker, the suggested model may become a useful tool for further optimizing cement-based engineered composites. &copy; 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

VMeasurements were made of the number of fibers per unit cross-sectional area in steel fiber reinforced concrete specimens incorporating various volume fractions of fibers of different types. Based on statistical evaluation of the measured values, the differences in fiber concentration at different location on the cross section were assessed. Theoretical expressions were derived for the number of fibers per unit cross-sectional area in the fiber reinforced concrete, with due consideration given to the effects of the surrounding boundaries. The effects of vibration on reorientation of steel fibers in concrete were investigated through comparisons between the computed and measured values of number of fibers per unit cross-sectional area.

VIn the paper an overview is presented of recent results obtained in a comprehensive research (in progress) on the relation between manufacturing processes, fibre anisotropy and fracture properties of hybrid fibre concrete containing three different types of steel fibres. Since manufacturing relates to specific fibre orientations and thus to specific fracture behavior, these parts of the research are presented together in this paper. The experiments conducted confirm that a strong increase of flexural strength and ductility can be obtained when fibres cocktails are applied. The fibres tend to align along the walls of moulds, and it is shown that these highly reinforced surface layers add significantly to the strength of the beams. The fibre alignment can be affected by the viscosity of the concrete mixture in the fresh state, which allows to 'place' fibres at those locations where they are most needed. Finally, impregnation experiments show that pre-peak cracking is indeed in the form of multiple cracking, which localize into a major crack beyond peak. The localized crack is prevented to open rapidly by the bridging of the largest fibres present in the fibre cocktail. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VThe flexural fatigue characteristics of two different shotcreted engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene (PE) fibers respectively were tested under four-point bending. The failure mechanisms and characteristics were investigated in comparison with a shotcreted steel fiber reinforced cement. The results showed that both ECCs exhibited a unique fatigue stress-life relationship that is represented by a bilinear function on a semilogarithmic scale. The failure mechanism of ECCs involved the development of multiple cracks, and the number of cracks was higher when the fatigue stress level was higher. The difference in crack opening displacement results from their different fiber bridging characteristics. PVA fibers tended to break under fatigue, while PE fibers tended to pullout. Although PE-ECC provided more cracks at the same fatigue stress, level, PVA-ECC showed larger deformation than PE-ECC because each crack width of PE-ECC was smaller than that of PVA-ECC. The deformation is shown to be governed by the number of cracks as well as the crack width, where the fiber bridging characteristics are related to either fiber rupture or fiber pullout. ASCE.

VImpedance measurements were made during the debonding and pullout of a fully embedded, crack-bridging single steel fiber from a cement matrix. Nyquist plots gave evidence of two hulk arcs, and the "cusp" between them proved to be sensitive to both debonding and pullout of the embedded fiber. Physical simulations that used a steel wire in tap water were applied to interpret the debonding and pull-out results. The cusp resistance from impedance spectroscopy provided quantitative information about the extent of pullout and. at least qualitatively, correlated with the debond length before pullout. Impedance measurements on both sides of the matrix crack showed that crack deflection and debonding occurred on both sides symmetrically.

VIn cement-based materials the full range from brittle to ductile fracture can be achieved by changing the material structure, the loading conditions, the specimen size and/or the boundary conditions. Considering just the material, at one side of the spectrum hardened cement paste behaves brittle, whereas at the other side, new fibre reinforced cements may behave ductile. Structural conditions affect the brittleness/ductility as well, and by simply changing the loading (uniaxial tension, uniaxial and confined compression, etc.), the specimen/structure size or by changing the boundary conditions the full range from brittle to ductile response can be observed. Basically there is no difference in behaviour between the various loading cases and the same four-stage fracture process can always be identified. The four 'universal' stages are the linear elastic regime, the microcrack regime (before the maximum load is reached), the macrocrack regime (viz. the first, usually steep part of the softening curve), and the bridging stage. Microcracks are defined as cracks that can be arrested by elements in the material structure, whereas macrocracks can only be delayed/ arrested by means or structural measures at a larger scale than the material structure. In this paper it is tried to develop a unified view on fracture of materials belonging to this broad class, which may be seen as conceptual framework for an all encompassing fracture model for cementitious materials. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

VControlling preferentially oriented fibers in short-fiber reinforced composites is of great interest in determining various properties of the materials. This paper presents a new technique, the magnetic anisotropy measurement, which can effectively determine the fiber orientation in short-fiber reinforced composites. Theoretical magnetic torque curves are calculated for the composites with several different fiber distributions. The results are compared with those in prior work; the orientation descriptor obtained from the magnetic anisotropy measurement is mathematically equivalent to the well-known Hermans' orientation parameter.

VMaterials with quasi-brittle stress strain curves exhibit desirable properties such as enhanced durability, flaw tolerance and toughness. This study reveals that steel microfiber reinforced cement based composites exhibit such quasi-brittle behavior. Mechanical properties of steel microfiber reinforced cement based composites are obtained through flexure and splitting tension tests. The cracking process and crack fiber interactions that lead to the quasi-brittle behavior in these composites were investigated. The strength and toughness enhancement is associated with crack wake mechanisms. Aggregate bridging and pullout and secondary crack formations associated with microfiber bridging sites are predominant during the strain hardening regime. Multiple secondary microcracks perpendicular to the fiber/matrix interface is the dominant failure mode beyond peak load in the strain softening regime.

VA model has been formulated for analyzing the influence of fiber inclination angle on its rupture load in fiber reinforced cementitious composite. As a stiff fiber is pulled with an angle to the direction of pulling, the fiber rupture load decreases compared to the case with zero inclination angles. This phenomenon is called fiber apparent strength (defined as rupture load divided by fiber cross-section area) degradation. A parametric study, including the influence of elastic moduli of fiber and matrix, fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength as well as fiber orientation in matrix on the fiber apparent strength is carried out. The model results indicate that with the increase of fiber inclination angle, fiber apparent strength decreases. In addition, fiber apparent strength degradation degree is influenced by the elastic moduli of fiber and matrix and fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength. A fiber rupture test of carbon fiber in cementitious matrix was used for model verification. Model predictions based on independent parametric input compare favorably with experimental measurements of fiber apparent strength. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

VThis paper presents a rhetorical discussion on the subject of fiber-reinforced concrete, FRC. It is intended as an overview of the types of commercially available FRCs and how they work. It discusses commonly applied terminology and models of mechanical behavior that form a basis for understanding material performance without presenting mathematical details. Historical review is intended to help build a background for what is currently understood about FRC rather than as historical reporting. References from both early and contemporary authors are included as a means of tying the subject together along a time line. 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

VFor calculating interface properties from pullout tests, a simple theoretical model is proposed. The model enables calculating of the following material parameters: the parameter of shear stiffness of the fiber2013matrix boundary layer, the shear bond strength, the frictional bond strength and the specific interfacial fracture energy. These parameters can be determined from the slope of the load-slip curve, the maximum pullout load and the corresponding slip value. Slip-controlled, multiple-fiber pullout tests were conducted in a closed-loop test system. The effects of embedment length of fibers on the model-predicted material parameters were examined. The model predictions were satisfactorily compared with some previously published test data.

VThe effects of concrete strength, coarse aggregate quantity and type, and reinforcing bar geometry on splice strength are evaluated. Results for 64 splice specimens with reinforcing bars with relative rib areas (ratio of projected rib area normal to bar axis to the product of the nominal bar perimeter and the center-to-center rib spacing) ranging from 0.069 to 0.141, concrete strengths ranging from 4250 to 15,650 psi (29 to 108 MPa), and quantities of limestone and basalt coarse aggregate ranging from 1586 to 1908 lb/yd3 (941 to 1132 kg/m3) are reported. The results are combined with the ACI Committee 408 database to develop design equations for development and splice length, which are then compared with the design criteria in ACI 318-99. For splices not confined by transverse reinforcement, the 1/4 power of compressive strength f prime c best characterizes the effect of concrete strength on splice strength. f prime c3/4 characterizes the effect of concrete strength on the additional splice strength provided by transverse reinforcement. The splice strength of bars confined by transverse reinforcement increases with an increase in relative rib area and bar diameter. The use of stronger coarse aggregate results in an increase in splice strength for bars both with and without confining reinforcement. For splices confined by transverse reinforcement, the higher the quantity of coarse aggregate, the greater the contribution of transverse reinforcement to splice strength. The expressions characterizing the splice strength of reinforcing bars accurately represent the development/splice strength of bottom-cast uncoated bars as a function of member geometry, concrete strength, relative rib area, bar size, and confinement, provided by both concrete and transverse reinforcement. The new design expressions are superior to the design criteria in ACI 318-99 in terms of both safety and economy. The criteria in ACI 318-99 for developed bars and Class A splices are unconservative for No. 6 (No. 19) and smaller bars.

VA fatigue study was performed on two commercial high-strength concretes\u000aof 70 MPa and 95 MPa with water/cementitious material ratios of 0.28 and\u000a0.23, respectively. Specimens were cast at the construction site and cured in the\u000alaboratory. Tests were performed under constant amplitude, and strains were measured\u000acontinuously using strain gauges. The McCall model for fatigue life prediction\u000awas found to be satisfactory, and safer than the usual W6hler curves. Strain evolution\u000aand stiffness degradation with the number of cycles in high-strength concrete\u000awere found to be similar to those of normal concrete. Strain at failure under cyclic\u000aloading was found to be of the same order as the strain at peak load under static\u000aloading. Interesting correlations between strain rate and number of cycles to failure\u000aand between stiffness decrease rate and number of cycles to failure were found.\u000aEvolution of the hysteresis loop was studied. Energy dissipated was found to decrease\u000aafter the first cycles, and increased steadily thereafter up to failure. Finally,\u000athe differences in deformation characteristics between the two high-strength concretes\u000astudied in this investigation were analyzed.

VIn this paper, the behavior of concrete under static and fatigue compressive load is studied. Cylindrical specimens were\u000asubjected to static cyclic and constant amplitude fatigue loading. The static cyclic tests were performed by unloading and reloading the\u000aspecimen at three different points in the postpeak period of the static loading response. Low cycle, high amplitude fatigue tests were\u000aperformed to failure using three load amplitudes. It is found that under the term of structural compliance the static compressive response\u000aof concrete can be used as an envelope for the fatigue failure compressive response. The change rate of stiffness or compliance under\u000afatigue loading follows a two-stage process: a deceleration stage followed by an acceleration stage up to failure. The failure mechanisms\u000afor both static and fatigue loading are explained by the band damage zone model and found to be consistent in the term of an inelastic\u000adisplacement. The results agree well with the previous research work.

VThis study attempted to develop a model for the stress-strain relationship in compression of frost-damaged concrete subjected to fatigue loading. Concrete specimens were prepared and exposed to freeze-thaw cycles followed by application of static and fatigue loading. The strains induced during the freeze-thaw test were carefully measured as well as during a mechanical loading test. It was found that the static strength and the fatigue life of concrete decreases as increasing irreversible tensile strain was induced by frost action. A stress-strain model for frost-damaged concrete under application of static and fatigue loading based on the degradation of initial stiffness caused by frost damage was presented. The degradation of initial stiffness for damaged concrete was empirically formulated as a function of remaining expansion caused by freeze-thaw cycles. The plastic strain under the application of mechanical static and fatigue loading for frost-damaged concrete is higher than that for original concrete. Therefore, plastic strain for damaged concrete was formulated as not only the function of strain level under mechanical loading, but also the function of irreversible strain caused by frost action. The unloading and reloading stiffness factors were introduced to explain the change of stiffness as increasing the number of loading cycles by considering the effect of the degree of frost damage.\u000a\u000a\u000aRead More: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/ref/10.1061/%28ASCE%290899-1561%282008%2920%3A1%2837%29

VIn this study, shear-flexure coupling behavior of steel fiberreinforced\u000aconcrete (SFRC) beams was investigated. As part of the\u000aexperimental study, 12 SFRC beams were tested under low-to-high\u000ashear-to-moment ratios and with different quantities of steel fibers\u000aand longitudinal reinforcement. Both normal- and high-strength\u000aconcrete with steel fibers were evaluated. The test results were then\u000aused to validate the nonlinear modeling techniques developed for\u000aconsidering shear-flexure coupling effects in SFRC beams. Three\u000adifferent cases of transverse normal stress or strain profiles in the\u000abeam shear span were employed in the analytical model, depending\u000aon the presence and extent of yielding of the longitudinal steel bars.\u000aThe shear-flexure interaction model reproduced the degradation\u000aassociated with the shear behavior and ductility quite accurately.

VThis study deals with a modeling approach that integrates shear and flexure interaction to predict the response\u000aof reinforced concrete squat walls. The model incorporates RC panel behavior into a displacementbased\u000acolumn model by prescribing the average horizontal strain, at different wall heights, which is calibrated\u000ausing a 2D finite element formulation model (2D-FEM) that incorporated identical RC panel behavior.\u000aExperimental evidence shows relatively good correlation of the maximum and distribution over\u000athe wall height of the average horizontal strain prediction, with drift variation. The model shear strength\u000awas also compared to a database of 252 specimens, resulting in an average ratio of the predicted over the\u000aexperimental shear strength .Vmodel=Vexp/ of 1.13 for all the cases, with a coefficient of variation of 0.25,\u000aindicating a reasonably good correlation with the tests results. A sensitivity study indicates that the model\u000astrength prediction ratio, that is, the model over the experimental strength value, is almost nil sensitive\u000ato the vertical and horizontal web reinforcement strength ratio, as well as the longitudinal boundary reinforcement\u000astrength ratio, cross-sectional shape (rectangular or enlarged section), boundary condition\u000a(cantilever or fixed-end condition) and the axial load level supporting the reliability of the model.

VThe fatigue behaviour of innovative hybrid FRP??Â¨Â¦a??aâ\u201a¬?UHPC beams under flexural loading is investigated in this\u000apaper. The beams were made up of a pultruded GFRP hollow box section beam with a cast-in-place UHPC\u000alayer on top and either a CFRP or SFRP sheet bonded along the bottom. Four hybrid beams were tested\u000aunder variable amplitude loading, to determine the effect of cyclic loading on flexural strength and stiffness.\u000aAnalysis also included the development of a modified S??Â¨Â¦a??aâ\u201a¬?N curve and evaluation of fatigue damage\u000ausing the Palmgren??Â¨Â¦a??aâ\u201a¬?Miner rule. It was found that insignificant loss in strength and stiffness occurred for\u000aall beams, where the fatigue damage estimated using the Palmgren??Â¨Â¦a??aâ\u201a¬?Miner rule overestimated the fatigue\u000alife. It was postulated, by comparison, that the hybrid beams reinforced with CFRP sheets may perform\u000abetter under fatigue loading than the beams reinforced with SFRP sheets.

VThis paper provides the experimental results of a new hybrid beam intended for use in bridge applications.\u000aThe hybrid beams were made up of pultruded Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) hollow box\u000asection beams strengthened with a layer of Ultra-High-Performance-Concrete (UHPC) on top and either\u000aa sheet of Carbon FRP (CFRP) or Steel FRP (SFRP) on the bottom of the beam. Four hybrid FRP??Â¨Â¦a??aâ\u201a¬?UHPC\u000abeams were tested along with one control GFRP hollow box beam under four-point static flexural loading.\u000aTwo types of beams were tested (Phase I and Phase II), which incorporated different connection mechanisms\u000aat the GFRP??Â¨Â¦a??aâ\u201a¬?UHPC interface. It was concluded that the hybrid beams had higher flexural strength\u000aand stiffness than the control beam, where the beams reinforced with SFRP showed greater percent cost\u000aeffectiveness than beams reinforced with CFRP. In addition, the improved connection mechanism used in\u000aPhase II beams was found to provide adequate interface bond strength to maintain full composite action\u000auntil ultimate failure.

VRecent advances in nanotechnology research have been applied to improve the durability, serviceability, and safety of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). Furthermore, improvements in the compressive strength of concrete have allowed concrete structural member size and self-weight to be significantly reduced, which has in turn resulted in cost reduction and structural aesthetic enhancement. Among many UHPCs currently available on the market, the most representative ones are ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC) and reactive powder concrete (RPC). Even though UHSC and RPC have compressive strengths of over 100 MPa, their safety has been questioned due to possible ultra-brittle failure behavior and unfavorable cost-to-performance efficiency. The blast-resistant capacities of UHSC and RPC were experimentally evaluated to determine the possibility of using UHSC and RPC in concrete structures susceptible to terrorist attacks or accidental impacts. Slump flow, compressive strength, split tensile strength, elastic modulus, and flexure strength tests were carried out. In addition, ANFO blast tests were performed on reinforced UHSC and RPC panels. Incidental and reflected pressures, as well as maximum and residual displacements and the strains of rebar and concrete were measured. Blast damage and failure modes of the reinforced panel specimens were recorded. Our results showed that UHSC and RPC have better blast explosion resistance than normal strength concrete. The study results are discussed in detail.

VThe size effect on the flexural behavior of ultra-high-performance hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete (UHP-HFRC) was investigated. Three different sizes of specimens were tested using four-point bending in a three-dimensional scale: 50 ??aâ\u201a¬?Â¡Ã\u20ac 50 ??aâ\u201a¬?Â¡Ã\u20ac 150 mm3 (small), 100 ??aâ\u201a¬?Â¡Ã\u20ac 100 ??aâ\u201a¬?Â¡Ã\u20ac 300 mm3 (medium), and 150 ??aâ\u201a¬?Â¡Ã\u20ac 150 ??aâ\u201a¬?Â¡Ã\u20ac 450 mm3 (large). For each size, two UHP-HFRCs with different fiber contents were tested to investigate the influence of tensile ductility on the size effect of UHP-HFRC in flexure. UHP-HFRC1 contained 1.0% twisted steel macro-fiber (T-fiber) and 0.5% short, smooth steel micro-fiber (SS-fiber) by volume, while UHP-HFRC2 contained a blend of 1.0% T-fiber and 1.0% SS-fiber. Both UHP-HFRCs demonstrated clear size effect on flexural strength, normalized deflection, and normalized energy absorption capacity. Furthermore, the flexural behavior of UHP-HFRC1, with its lower tensile ductility, was more sensitive to the size of the specimen.

VA significant amount of attention has been directed toward the use of fibre reinforced polymer\u000a(FRP) materials in structural applications, particularly as main components in hybrid structural members. As\u000aa result, the need for an effective connection mechanism that can maintain full composite action at the interface\u000abetween adjacent dissimilar materials is critical in order to achieve optimum performance of the hybrid\u000astructural members. The objective of this experimental program was to investigate the bond performance\u000abetween glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) plates and cast-in-place Ultra-High-Performance- Concrete\u000a(UHPC) using epoxy bonded coarse silica sand aggregates at the bond interface. Both shear and tension\u000atests were conducted using three different types of epoxy adhesives. The general effectiveness of the\u000aconnection mechanism at the bond interface as well as the relative performance of each epoxy adhesive\u000aused were investigated. Analysis showed that, of the three epoxy adhesives tested, the specimens bonded\u000aat the interface between the UHPC and GFRP plates using the moisture tolerant epoxy adhesive intended\u000afor bonding of hardened concrete and steel performed the best.

VThe flexural behavior of fiber-reinforced concretes (FRCs) is typically\u000aevaluated through standard tests of beams under either threeor\u000afour-point loading. Although these test methods are standardized,\u000atest results could vary significantly depending on specimen\u000asize, concrete casting method, and support devices used.\u000aResults from a comprehensive experimental program aimed at\u000aevaluating the influence of these test parameters on material flexural\u000abehavior are presented. The investigation focused on ultrahigh-\u000astrength (>150 MPa [22 ksi]) FRC, typically referred to as\u000aultra-high-performance FRC (UHP-FRC). By varying specimen\u000asize, casting method, and support conditions to account for those\u000anormally used by researchers in accordance with ASTM C1609/\u000aC1609M and RILEM TC 162-TDF, equivalent bending strengths\u000aas low as 10 MPa (1.4 ksi) and as high as 29 MPa (4.2 ksi) were\u000aobtained using the same UHP-FRC mixture design. The degree of\u000arestraint developed at the supports intended to work as rollers was\u000aalso evaluated through finite element analyses. The use of a shear\u000afriction coefficient of 0.4, which was found to be representative of\u000athat in the \u201chigh-friction\u201d supports used in this study, led to an\u000aincrease in bending strength of approximately 30% compared to\u000abeams with no axial restraint. The test results also indicate that\u000aa more specific recommendation on the casting method is needed\u000awhen using highly workable FRC, given the variability in results\u000abetween beams constructed following various casting methods.

VConcrete bridge decks represent a critical component of the nation\u2019s bridge network;\u000a3 however, these components are deteriorating at a rapid rate. This deterioration can be attributed\u000a4 to a number of factors, but winter salt application, the diffusion of chlorides to the reinforcing\u000a5 steel, and the eventual corrosion of the reinforcement is a primary culprit. Multiple protection\u000a6 solutions exist including: concrete protective systems, sealers, additional cover to the\u000a7 reinforcement, membranes, and epoxy coated reinforcement, but each of these solutions have\u000a8 shortcomings and do not completely address the problem. Ultra-high performance concrete, a\u000a9 relatively new material with exceptional strength and durability characteristics, may be a solution\u000a10 to these problems when used as a thin overlay on bridge decks.\u000a11 To evaluate UHPC for application as an overlay, an experimental study was performed to\u000a12 evaluate the bond strength between a UHPC overlay and a normal concrete substrate with\u000a13 different types of surface textures including, smooth, low roughness, and high roughness. Slant\u000a14 shear (ASTM C 882-05) and splitting prism (modified ASTM C 496) tests were performed to\u000a15 quantify the bond strength under combined compression and shear, and indirect tension. Test\u000a16 results demonstrated that under compressive loading (slant shear test), the bond strength is\u000a17 greater than the strength of the substrate, provided that a surface texture greater than the standard\u000a18 smooth finished mortar surface is used. For the bond strength under indirect tension (splitting\u000a19 prism test), results were not highly sensitive to the surface roughness. In both the cases, the\u000a20 measured bond strengths fall within the ranges specified in the ACI Guide for the Selection of\u000a21 Materials for the Repair of Concrete.

VThe AASHTO strategic plan in 2005 identified extending the service\u000alife of bridges and accelerating bridge construction as two of the grand\u000achallenges in bridge engineering. Previous studies have shown that\u000ausing a prefabricated full-depth precast concrete deck system not only\u000aaccelerated the bridge deck rehabilitation process but also extended\u000aits service life with reduced user delays and lower life-cycle costs. The\u000arecent use of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) in the United\u000aStates for bridge applications has proved efficient and economical because\u000aof its superior structural and durability characteristics. On the basis of\u000athe advantages of UHPC and precast systems, a design for a full-depth\u000aUHPC waffle deck panel system was developed. A full-scale, single-span,\u000a60-ft long by 33-ft wide prototype bridge with full-depth prefabricated\u000aUHPC waffle deck panels has been planned as a replacement bridge in\u000aWapello County, Iowa. In support of this project, structural performance\u000aand constructability of the UHPC waffle deck system and its critical\u000aconnections were studied through an experimental program at Iowa\u000aState University. Two prefabricated, full-depth, UHPC waffle deck\u000apanels were connected to two 24-ft long precast prestressed girders,\u000aand the system was tested under service, fatigue, and ultimate loads.\u000aOn the basis of the test observations and results and the experience\u000agained from fabrication of deck panels and casting of UHPC infill joints\u000a(transverse and longitudinal), the prefabricated UHPC waffle deck\u000asystem concept was found to be a viable option to achieve the goals of\u000athe AASHTO strategic plan.
