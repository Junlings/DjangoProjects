The City of Calgary required testing of a full-scale prototype panel for both static and dynamic responses. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to determine the boundary conditions to be imposed on one edge of the prototype panel during the tests to simulate the presence of the other two in the actual structure. The FEA was also used to determine the critical (independent) snow and wind loading cases. The analyses and the testing procedures for the full-scale instrumented panel are described. The panel withstood both full factored loads without damage. The methods for manufacturing and assembling the canopy and roofs are also described.

The result of the analyses used to develop the new design criteria indicate that increasing lap splice length, without providing transverse reinforcement, does not provide an adequate level of ductility in high-strength concrete members. Adequate ductility can be achieved by using a minimum splice length, as defined by ACI 318-95 for beams without transverse reinforcement, plus a minimum quantity of transverse reinforcement over the tension development/lap splice length with an area equal to 50% of the area of the bars being developed/spliced.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This limitation was first introduced in the 1989 edition of ACI 318. In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this limitation and develop provisions for its removal, a two-phase investigation was carried out at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This paper provides a compute summary of the experimental investigations conducted in both phases of the project. Phase I of the investigation was supported by the Portland Cement Association, while Phase II was supported by the National Science Foundation. During the two phases, 70 beam specimens with tension reinforcement splices were tested. The parameters studied included: Bar size, length and deformation type of the reinforcing bars, amount of transverse reinforcement over the splice length, casting position, and concrete compressive strength. Results of the investigation are used to discuss observed differences in how reinforcing bars in tension develop in normal and high-strength concretes (HSCs), to develop hypotheses to explain these differences, and to suggest conditions for removal of the current concrete compressive strength limitation of the ACI 318 Building Code, which applies to the calculation of tension development length and tension splice length.

By means of nanoindentation tests on nondegraded and calcium leached cement paste, the paper confirms the existence of two types of C-S-H, and investigates the distinct role played by the two phases on the elastic properties of cement-based materials. It is found that (1) high-density C-S-H are mechanically less affected by calcium leaching than low density C-S-H, and (2) the volume fractions occupied by the two phases in the C-S-H matrix are not affected by calcium leaching. The nanoindentation results also provide quantitative evidence, suggesting that the elastic properties of the C-S-H phase are intrinsic material properties that do not depend on mix proportions of cement-based materials. The material properties and volume fractions are used in a novel two-step homogenization model, that predicts the macroscopic elastic properties of cement pastes with high accuracy. Combined with advanced physical chemistry models that allow, for a given w/c ratio, determination of the volume fractions of the two types of C-S-H, the model can be applied to any cement paste, with or without Portlandite, Clinker, and so on. In particular, from an application of the model to decalcified cement pastes, it is shown that that the decalcification of the C-S-H phase is the primary source of the macroscopic elastic modulus degradation, that dominates over the effect of the dissolution of Portlandite in cement-based material systems. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the investigation is to examine the applicability of the ACI 318-02 equation and a current proposed equation by Zuo and Darwin on bond behavior of steel reinforcement to the concrete member. The experimental program included two phases. The first phase of the experimental program consisted of testing four beam-end specimens reinforced with MMFX steel bars, whereas the second phase included testing eight beam-splice specimens reinforced with MMFX steel bars. The selected four factors considered in this study were bar size, level of confinement, bonded length, and bar cast position. The bond behavior of the MMFX steel bars was found to be similar to that of conventional Grade 420 MPa (60 ksi) steel up to the proportional limit of 550 MPa (80 ksi). The bond strength of the MMFX significantly changes as the tensile stresses developed in the bar exceed the proportional limit. The test results indicated that both the ACI 318-02 equation and the current proposed equation by Zuo and Darwin on bond are adequate and resulted in conservative prediction at low stress levels up to 550 MPa (80 ksi). At high stress levels, however, the prediction using both equations is unconservative due to the nonlinear behavior of the MMFX stress-strain relationship. Based on the limited number of specimens considered in this study, modification to both the ACI 318-02 equation and the Zuo and Darwin equation is proposed to predict the bond forces beyond the proportional limit for MMFX steel bars.

In the case of fibers randomly inclined with respect to crack surfaces, the so-called frictional snubbing effect must be added to the previous contributions, if the energy released during crack growth has to be computed. Of course, snubbing forces are not present when fibers are perfectly orthogonal to crack surfaces. As the classical formulas are not always effective in the evaluation of snubbing phenomenon, a cohesive interface model is here proposed for a more precise definition of the frictional snubbing forces.

Here we present results from three experimental techniques that are particularly suited to analyzing disordered nanoporous materials: small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), weight and length changes during equilibrium drying, and nanoindentation. Particular attention is paid to differences between pastes of different ages and cured at different temperatures. The SANS and equilibrium drying results indicate that hydration of cement paste at 20 &deg;C forms a low-density (LD) C-S-H gel structure with a range of gel pore sizes and a relatively low packing fraction of solid particles. This fine structure may persist indefinitely under saturated conditions. However, if the paste is dried or is cured at elevated temperatures (60 &deg;C or greater) the structure collapses toward a denser (less porous) and more stable configuration with fewer large gel pores, resulting in a greater amount of capillary porosity. Nanoindentation measurements of pastes cured at different temperatures demonstrate in all cases the existence of two C-S-H structures with different characteristic values of the indentation modulus. The average value of the modulus of the LD C-S-H is the same for all pastes tested to date, and a micromechanical analysis indicates that this value corresponds to the denser and more stable configuration of LD C-S-H.

The cyclic tests were performed by unloading the specimen at different points in the postpeak part of the quasi-static loading response. Low cycle, high amplitude fatigue tests were performed to failure using four different load ranges. The crack mouth opening displacement was continuously monitored throughout the loading process. Crack propagation caused by quasi-static and fatigue loads is described in terms of fracture mechanics. It is shown that the crack propagation in the postpeak part of the quasi-static load response is predicted using the critical value of the mode I stress intensity factor (KIC). The ultimate deformation of the specimen during the fatigue test is compared with that from the quasi-static test; it is demonstrated that the quasi-static deformation is insufficient as a fatigue failure criterion. It is observed that crack growth owing to constant-amplitude fatigue loading comprises two phases: a deceleration stage when there is a decrease in crack growth rate with increasing crack length, followed by an acceleration stage where the rate of crack growth increases at a steady rate. The crack length where the rate of crack growth changes from deceleration to acceleration is shown to be equal to the crack length at the peak load of the quasi-static response. Analytical expressions for crack growth in the deceleration and acceleration stages are developed, wherein the expressions for crack growth rate in the deceleration stage are developed using the R-curve concept, and the acceleration stage is shown to follow the Paris law.

Furthermore, existing models of SFRC flexural behaviour do not fully capture what happens at the cracked section in terms of the fibre-matrix interactions. Typical of these approaches is the modelling of the tension zone from single fibre pull-out tests, which is problematic in measurement of the load-displacement relationship, the interaction of groups of fibres and the extensive testing required to cover all permutations of fibre geometry. An alternative approach is proposed where the average pull-out response of the fibres bridging the cracked zone is inferred from flexural beam tests.

Thus in this paper an attempt has been made to develop an analytical model for predicting the torque-twist response of SFRC members subjected to pure torsional loads considering the softening effect of concrete. Experimental validation was also presented in this paper.

The ratio between the concrete contribution for members with and without shear reinforcement is usually assumed constant, independent of the amount of shear reinforcement, flexural reinforcement ratio, and bond conditions of the shear reinforcement. The limitations of such an approach are discussed in this paper and a new theoretical model, based on the critical shear crack theory, is presented to investigate the strength and ductility of shear-reinforced slabs.

In this study, a low-profile UHPC deck system has been developed that satisfies the strength and serviceability requirements, addresses the concerns with open-grid steel decks, and meets the strict self-weight requirements for moveable bridges. The detailed experimental study shows that the proposed system has great potential to serve as an alternative to open-grid steel decks.

The experiments conducted confirm that a strong increase of flexural strength and ductility can be obtained when fibres cocktails are applied. The fibres tend to align along the walls of moulds, and it is shown that these highly reinforced surface layers add significantly to the strength of the beams. The fibre alignment can be affected by the viscosity of the concrete mixture in the fresh state, which allows to \'place\' fibres at those locations where they are most needed.

A stress-strain model for frost-damaged concrete under application of static and fatigue loading based on the degradation of initial stiffness caused by frost damage was presented. The degradation of initial stiffness for damaged concrete was empirically formulated as a function of remaining expansion caused by freeze-thaw cycles. The plastic strain under the application of mechanical static and fatigue loading for frost-damaged concrete is higher than that for original concrete. Therefore, plastic strain for damaged concrete was formulated as not only the function of strain level under mechanical loading, but also the function of irreversible strain caused by frost action. The unloading and reloading stiffness factors were introduced to explain the change of stiffness as increasing the number of loading cycles by considering the effect of the degree of frost damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead More: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/ref/10.1061/%28ASCE%290899-1561%282008%2920%3A1%2837%29', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
