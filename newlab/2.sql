In this paper, the new design model is presented and its capabilities\r\nshall be demonstrated. The effects of the changes compared to the current standard design model are\r\nalso shown.

For diversified application of\r\nUHPC the examination of cyclic loading in tension-compression is of considerable practical\r\nrelevance.\r\nRepresenting this kind of loading 120 single-level fatigue tests were performed on UHPC\r\nspecimens without reinforcement.

The position of the loading surface in the energy release space between the initial and the bounding surfaces denotes the level of damage state. The varying size of the limit fracture surface for fatigue loading is obtained through establishing the relationship between cumulative damage and the onset of the energy release in a cycle, which simulates the degenerative process of the stiffness of concrete under cyclic loading.

Based on recent research on the lap splice strength of reinforcing bars in high-strength concrete, modifications to current design criteria are formulated that will allow removal of the limit on the square root of the compressive strength, ensure adequate ductility and bond, and improve the overall safety of the tension development and lap splice criteria in ACI 318-95 for concrete with strengths above 10,000 psi. The result of the analyses used to develop the new design criteria indicate that increasing lap splice length, without providing transverse reinforcement, does not provide an adequate level of ductility in high-strength concrete members. Adequate ductility can be achieved by using a minimum splice length, as defined by ACI 318-95 for beams without transverse reinforcement, plus a minimum quantity of transverse reinforcement over the tension development/lap splice length with an area equal to 50% of the area of the bars being developed/spliced.'),

This limitation was first introduced in the 1989 edition of ACI 318. In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this limitation and develop provisions for its removal, a two-phase investigation was carried out at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This paper provides a compute summary of the experimental investigations conducted in both phases of the project. Phase I of the investigation was supported by the Portland Cement Association, while Phase II was supported by the National Science Foundation. During the two phases, 70 beam specimens with tension reinforcement splices were tested. The parameters studied included: Bar size, length and deformation type of the reinforcing bars, amount of transverse reinforcement over the splice length, casting position, and concrete compressive strength. Results of the investigation are used to discuss observed differences in how reinforcing bars in tension develop in normal and high-strength concretes (HSCs), to develop hypotheses to explain these differences, and to suggest conditions for removal of the current concrete compressive strength limitation of the ACI 318 Building Code, which applies to the calculation of tension development length and tension splice length. Development of code language provisions for removal of the current limitation, is discussed elsewhere. In this paper, HSC is defined as concrete with compressive strength exceeding 10,000 psi (69 MPa).'),

Twelve beam splice specimens using No. 11 reinforcing bars and concrete with compressive strengths exceeding 14,000 psi (97 MPa) were tested. The effect of several variables on bond capacity in high-strength concrete is discussed and a failure hypothesis explaining the observed behavior during the experimental phase of the study is presented.

However, single fiber pullout tests indicate that densification only enhances the brass-cement paste interface bond strength and not the other systems. Further microscopy investigation of the surface of fibers peeled off from a composite fracture surface and of the groove left by the fiber on the cement paste suggests that bond failure for the brass-cement system is of a cohesive type, whereas bond failure for the other two systems is of an adhesive type.

By means of nanoindentation tests on nondegraded and calcium leached cement paste, the paper confirms the existence of two types of C-S-H, and investigates the distinct role played by the two phases on the elastic properties of cement-based materials. It is found that (1) high-density C-S-H are mechanically less affected by calcium leaching than low density C-S-H, and (2) the volume fractions occupied by the two phases in the C-S-H matrix are not affected by calcium leaching. The nanoindentation results also provide quantitative evidence, suggesting that the elastic properties of the C-S-H phase are intrinsic material properties that do not depend on mix proportions of cement-based materials. The material properties and volume fractions are used in a novel two-step homogenization model, that predicts the macroscopic elastic properties of cement pastes with high accuracy. Combined with advanced physical chemistry models that allow, for a given w/c ratio, determination of the volume fractions of the two types of C-S-H, the model can be applied to any cement paste, with or without Portlandite, Clinker, and so on. In particular, from an application of the model to decalcified cement pastes, it is shown that that the decalcification of the C-S-H phase is the primary source of the macroscopic elastic modulus degradation, that dominates over the effect of the dissolution of Portlandite in cement-based material systems. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The orientation factor is defined here as the average length of the projection on the longitudinal axis of all fibres crossing a section, divided by the fibre length. Once the orientation factor is found, a simple calculation gives the number of fibres crossing a crack. Since the proposed approach is to a large extent new, there is a need for verification with test results.

The objective of the investigation is to examine the applicability of the ACI 318-02 equation and a current proposed equation by Zuo and Darwin on bond behavior of steel reinforcement to the concrete member. The experimental program included two phases. The first phase of the experimental program consisted of testing four beam-end specimens reinforced with MMFX steel bars, whereas the second phase included testing eight beam-splice specimens reinforced with MMFX steel bars. The selected four factors considered in this study were bar size, level of confinement, bonded length, and bar cast position. The bond behavior of the MMFX steel bars was found to be similar to that of conventional Grade 420 MPa (60 ksi) steel up to the proportional limit of 550 MPa (80 ksi). The bond strength of the MMFX significantly changes as the tensile stresses developed in the bar exceed the proportional limit. The test results indicated that both the ACI 318-02 equation and the current proposed equation by Zuo and Darwin on bond are adequate and resulted in conservative prediction at low stress levels up to 550 MPa (80 ksi). At high stress levels, however, the prediction using both equations is unconservative due to the nonlinear behavior of the MMFX stress-strain relationship. Based on the limited number of specimens considered in this study, modification to both the ACI 318-02 equation and the Zuo and Darwin equation is proposed to predict the bond forces beyond the proportional limit for MMFX steel bars.

As a result, the fracture energy of a fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is the sum of the cohesive forces of the matrix and of the pullout resistance given by the fibers crossing the crack. In the case of fibers randomly inclined with respect to crack surfaces, the so-called frictional snubbing effect must be added to the previous contributions, if the energy released during crack growth has to be computed. Of course, snubbing forces are not present when fibers are perfectly orthogonal to crack surfaces. As the classical formulas are not always effective in the evaluation of snubbing phenomenon, a cohesive interface model is here proposed for a more precise definition of the frictional snubbing forces. The model is able to predict adequately the experimental results obtained by pulling out steel fibers at different inclinations angles from cement-based matrices. By analyzing fibers with different bond properties, the proposed model can be also used to define the crack bridging capacity of both bonded and unbonded steel fibers. Moreover, it seems to suggest a more simplified approach for the definition of the postcracking response of FRC. 2008 ASCE.'),

The analytical model accurately reproduced experimental results of bond strength for reinforcing bars embedded in plain unconfined concrete with different ratios of concrete cover-to-bar diameter c/db, and having development/splice lengths of up to 60db. Also, the analytical predictions showed excellent agreement with limited experimental data of bond strength of reinforcing bars embedded in steel FRC. For plain unconfined concrete, normalization of bond strength relative to f prime c1/4, covering both NSC and HSC, leads to a more accurate prediction of experimental data and a more consistent trend in the bond results as compared to f prime c1/2. The use of fiber reinforcement significantly increases the development/splice strength and considerably enhances the ductility of bond failure. The increase in bond strength acquired using steel fibers may reach levels substantially larger than the maximum limit stipulated in the ACI building code for ordinary transverse reinforcement. Based on the results of the analysis, supported with experimental data, a design equation is proposed to evaluate the development/splice strength of reinforcing bars embedded in steel FRC.'),

The influences are due to changes in the interfacial microstructure and the content of sand.

Here we present results from three experimental techniques that are particularly suited to analyzing disordered nanoporous materials: small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), weight and length changes during equilibrium drying, and nanoindentation. Particular attention is paid to differences between pastes of different ages and cured at different temperatures. The SANS and equilibrium drying results indicate that hydration of cement paste at 20 &deg;C forms a low-density (LD) C-S-H gel structure with a range of gel pore sizes and a relatively low packing fraction of solid particles. This fine structure may persist indefinitely under saturated conditions. However, if the paste is dried or is cured at elevated temperatures (60 &deg;C or greater) the structure collapses toward a denser (less porous) and more stable configuration with fewer large gel pores, resulting in a greater amount of capillary porosity. Nanoindentation measurements of pastes cured at different temperatures demonstrate in all cases the existence of two C-S-H structures with different characteristic values of the indentation modulus. The average value of the modulus of the LD C-S-H is the same for all pastes tested to date, and a micromechanical analysis indicates that this value corresponds to the denser and more stable configuration of LD C-S-H. The experimental results presented here are interpreted in terms of a previously proposed quantitative \"colloid\" model of C-S-H gel, resulting in an improved understanding of the microstructural changes associated with drying and heat curing. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Notched concrete beams were tested in a three-point bending configuration. Specimens were subjected to quasi-static cyclic and constant amplitude fatigue loading. The cyclic tests were performed by unloading the specimen at different points in the postpeak part of the quasi-static loading response. Low cycle, high amplitude fatigue tests were performed to failure using four different load ranges. The crack mouth opening displacement was continuously monitored throughout the loading process. Crack propagation caused by quasi-static and fatigue loads is described in terms of fracture mechanics. It is shown that the crack propagation in the postpeak part of the quasi-static load response is predicted using the critical value of the mode I stress intensity factor (KIC). The ultimate deformation of the specimen during the fatigue test is compared with that from the quasi-static test; it is demonstrated that the quasi-static deformation is insufficient as a fatigue failure criterion. It is observed that crack growth owing to constant-amplitude fatigue loading comprises two phases: a deceleration stage when there is a decrease in crack growth rate with increasing crack length, followed by an acceleration stage where the rate of crack growth increases at a steady rate. The crack length where the rate of crack growth changes from deceleration to acceleration is shown to be equal to the crack length at the peak load of the quasi-static response. Analytical expressions for crack growth in the deceleration and acceleration stages are developed, wherein the expressions for crack growth rate in the deceleration stage are developed using the R-curve concept, and the acceleration stage is shown to follow the Paris law. It is observed that the crack length at failure for constant amplitude fatigue loading is comparable to that of the corresponding load in the postpeak part of the quasi-static response.

While fiber debonding has been widely investigated, the coupled fiber bending/matrix spalling mechanism has received little attention. In this paper, the fiber bending/matrix spalling mechanism is analyzed by treating the fiber as a beam bent on an elastic foundation with variable stiffness and the possibility of spalling. The foundation stiffness and spalling criterion are derived from a finite element analysis. The bridging stress due to bending alone as well as the total bridging stress are then obtained for the case with brittle fibers. Through this analysis, the effect of various microstructural parameters (such as fiber and matrix moduli, matrix spalling strain and fiber/matrix interfacial friction) on the behavior of random fiber composites can be studied.

The experimental results indicate the existence of an optimal fiber yield strength for the maximization of pullout load and pullout work. Inspection of the pullout curves as well as microscopic studies show that a higher fiber yield strength will result in more severe matrix spalling around the fiber exit point, thus limiting the further improvement in reinforcement efficiency.

Within the strain-softening category, one can distinguish between deflection-hardening and deflection-softening behavior. Several standard tests (ASTM, JCI, RILEM) are available to assess the characteristics of mostly strain-softening FRC composites through bending tests, but no standard test is currently available to characterize strain-hardening response in tension. Such composites have been described as high performance FRC or HPFRC composites. In this paper a proposal is put forth to characterize the response of strain-hardening FRC composites based on the results of direct tensile tests. The classification is based on several parameters which include a minimum value of elastic modulus, a minimum value of peak strain after first cracking, and the tensile strength level. While one of the key obstacles remains, that is, to develop a realistic and meaningful tensile test standard, some requirements on minimum specimen size, fiber size and aggregate size are also suggested.

The hand-sanded steel composite exhibited higher interfacial shear strength than the untreated and even neoalkoxy zirconate (Zr) treated steel fiber composites. This might be due to the enhanced mechanical interlocking, compared to possible hydrogen or covalent bonds. During the curing process, the contact resistivity decreased rapidly at the initial stage and then leveled off. Compared to the untreated case, the contact resistivity of either Zr-treated or hand-sanded steel fiber composites increased to infinity at the latter stage. The number of AE signals of hand-sanded steel fiber composite was much greater than those of the untreated and Zr-treated cases because of many interlayer failure signals. AE waveforms for pullout and frictional signals of the hand-sanded composite are larger than those of the untreated case. Under compressive loading for dual matrix composite, AE energy was much higher and the waveform was larger than those under tensile loading, because of their brittle but well-enduring ceramic nature against compressive stress.

The first part provides a theoretical elastic analysis of the pull-out force in terms of the misfit between wire and matrix, the coefficient of friction at the wire-matrix interface and the elastic constants of the materials. The resulting equation shows that the behavior is greatly influenced by the Poisson contraction of the wire during pull-out. Since the elastic modulus of the mortar is only five or six times smaller than that of the wire this can lead to a large reduction in stress-transfer across the wire-matrix interface and a corresponding reaction in pull-out force. In general the pull-out force is extremely sensitive to the wire-matrix misfit. The second part deals with an experimental study of the effect of surface finish of the wire and the effect of an externally applied confining pressure. The paper concludes with a discussion of the significance of this non-elastic behavior in the practical performance of fiber reinforced mortars and the role of mechanical deformations of the fibers.'),

This is holding back the material\'s development as a permanent structural material. Existing beam and slab test methods have problems with variability or their application in structural design. Furthermore, existing models of SFRC flexural behaviour do not fully capture what happens at the cracked section in terms of the fibre-matrix interactions. Typical of these approaches is the modelling of the tension zone from single fibre pull-out tests, which is problematic in measurement of the load-displacement relationship, the interaction of groups of fibres and the extensive testing required to cover all permutations of fibre geometry. An alternative approach is proposed where the average pull-out response of the fibres bridging the cracked zone is inferred from flexural beam tests. The characteristic load versus crack-mouth opening displacement behaviour for a particular fibre concrete then forms part of the stress and strain/displacement profile in a flexural analysis to predict moment capacity in a design calculation. The model is explained together with its validation by comparing the predicted load-displacement response for a range of fibre volumes in sprayed and cast SFRC. It is concluded that the analysis of beam load/deflection curves to infer the fibre pull-out response is a viable approach. It offers a promising solution to the need for a flexural design model combined with a practical method of characterizing the tensile contribution of steel fibres. RILEM 2006.'),

Concrete contribution is usually estimated as a fraction of the punching strength of members without shear reinforcement. The ratio between the concrete contribution for members with and without shear reinforcement is usually assumed constant, independent of the amount of shear reinforcement, flexural reinforcement ratio, and bond conditions of the shear reinforcement. The limitations of such an approach are discussed in this paper and a new theoretical model, based on the critical shear crack theory, is presented to investigate the strength and ductility of shear-reinforced slabs.

Open-grid steel decks present several problems, including poor rideability, high noise levels, susceptibility to fatigue damage, and high maintenance costs. There is a great opportunity to use advanced materials, such as ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), to develop new lightweight bridge deck systems. In this study, a low-profile UHPC deck system has been developed that satisfies the strength and serviceability requirements, addresses the concerns with open-grid steel decks, and meets the strict self-weight requirements for moveable bridges. The detailed experimental study shows that the proposed system has great potential to serve as an alternative to open-grid steel decks. Shear was the governing mode of failure in most of the specimens; however, it was not as abrupt and catastrophic as the commonly seen shear failure mode. Standard 180-degree hooks on both ends of the flexural reinforcement help avoid bond failure.

The failure mechanism of ECCs involved the development of multiple cracks, and the number of cracks was higher when the fatigue stress level was higher. The difference in crack opening displacement results from their different fiber bridging characteristics. PVA fibers tended to break under fatigue, while PE fibers tended to pullout. Although PE-ECC provided more cracks at the same fatigue stress, level, PVA-ECC showed larger deformation than PE-ECC because each crack width of PE-ECC was smaller than that of PVA-ECC.

A parametric study, including the influence of elastic moduli of fiber and matrix, fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength as well as fiber orientation in matrix on the fiber apparent strength is carried out.

Results for 64 splice specimens with reinforcing bars with relative rib areas (ratio of projected rib area normal to bar axis to the product of the nominal bar perimeter and the center-to-center rib spacing) ranging from 0.069 to 0.141, concrete strengths ranging from 4250 to 15,650 psi (29 to 108 MPa), and quantities of limestone and basalt coarse aggregate ranging from 1586 to 1908 lb/yd3 (941 to 1132 kg/m3) are reported. The results are combined with the ACI Committee 408 database to develop design equations for development and splice length, which are then compared with the design criteria in ACI 318-99. For splices not confined by transverse reinforcement, the 1/4 power of compressive strength f prime c best characterizes the effect of concrete strength on splice strength. f prime c3/4 characterizes the effect of concrete strength on the additional splice strength provided by transverse reinforcement. The splice strength of bars confined by transverse reinforcement increases with an increase in relative rib area and bar diameter. The use of stronger coarse aggregate results in an increase in splice strength for bars both with and without confining reinforcement. For splices confined by transverse reinforcement, the higher the quantity of coarse aggregate, the greater the contribution of transverse reinforcement to splice strength. The expressions characterizing the splice strength of reinforcing bars accurately represent the development/splice strength of bottom-cast uncoated bars as a function of member geometry, concrete strength, relative rib area, bar size, and confinement, provided by both concrete and transverse reinforcement.

A stress-strain model for frost-damaged concrete under application of static and fatigue loading based on the degradation of initial stiffness caused by frost damage was presented. The degradation of initial stiffness for damaged concrete was empirically formulated as a function of remaining expansion caused by freeze-thaw cycles. The plastic strain under the application of mechanical static and fatigue loading for frost-damaged concrete is higher than that for original concrete. Therefore, plastic strain for damaged concrete was formulated as not only the function of strain level under mechanical loading, but also the function of irreversible strain caused by frost action. The unloading and reloading stiffness factors were introduced to explain the change of stiffness as increasing the number of loading cycles by considering the effect of the degree of frost damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead More: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/ref/10.1061/%28ASCE%290899-1561%282008%2920%3A1%2837%29'),

As\r\na result, the need for an effective connection mechanism that can maintain full composite action at the interface\r\nbetween adjacent dissimilar materials is critical in order to achieve optimum performance of the hybrid\r\nstructural members. The objective of this experimental program was to investigate the bond performance\r\nbetween glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) plates and cast-in-place Ultra-High-Performance- Concrete\r\n(UHPC) using epoxy bonded coarse silica sand aggregates at the bond interface. Both shear and tension\r\ntests were conducted using three different types of epoxy adhesives. The general effectiveness of the\r\nconnection mechanism at the bond interface as well as the relative performance of each epoxy adhesive\r\nused were investigated.

Although these test methods are standardized,\r\ntest results could vary significantly depending on specimen\r\nsize, concrete casting method, and support devices used.\r\nResults from a comprehensive experimental program aimed at\r\nevaluating the influence of these test parameters on material flexural\r\nbehavior are presented. The investigation focused on ultrahigh-\r\nstrength (>150 MPa [22 ksi]) FRC, typically referred to as\r\nultra-high-performance FRC (UHP-FRC). By varying specimen\r\nsize, casting method, and support conditions to account for those\r\nnormally used by researchers in accordance with ASTM C1609/\r\nC1609M and RILEM TC 162-TDF, equivalent bending strengths\r\nas low as 10 MPa (1.4 ksi) and as high as 29 MPa (4.2 ksi) were\r\nobtained using the same UHP-FRC mixture design. The degree of\r\nrestraint developed at the supports intended to work as rollers was\r\nalso evaluated through finite element analyses. The use of a shear\r\nfriction coefficient of 0.4, which was found to be representative of\r\nthat in the “high-friction” supports used in this study, led to an\r\nincrease in bending strength of approximately 30% compared to\r\nbeams with no axial restraint. The test results also indicate that\r\na more specific recommendation on the casting method is needed\r\nwhen using highly workable FRC, given the variability in results\r\nbetween beams constructed following various casting methods.'),
  (431, 534, 'Interface Bond Characterization of Ultra-High Performance Concrete Overlays', '', 'Concrete bridge decks represent a critical component of the nation’s bridge network;\r\n3 however, these components are deteriorating at a rapid rate. This deterioration can be attributed\r\n4 to a number of factors, but winter salt application, the diffusion of chlorides to the reinforcing\r\n5 steel, and the eventual corrosion of the reinforcement is a primary culprit. Multiple protection\r\n6 solutions exist including: concrete protective systems, sealers, additional cover to the\r\n7 reinforcement, membranes, and epoxy coated reinforcement, but each of these solutions have\r\n8 shortcomings and do not completely address the problem. Ultra-high performance concrete, a\r\n9 relatively new material with exceptional strength and durability characteristics, may be a solution\r\n10 to these problems when used as a thin overlay on bridge decks.\r\n11 To evaluate UHPC for application as an overlay, an experimental study was performed to\r\n12 evaluate the bond strength between a UHPC overlay and a normal concrete substrate with\r\n13 different types of surface textures including, smooth, low roughness, and high roughness. Slant\r\n14 shear (ASTM C 882-05) and splitting prism (modified ASTM C 496) tests were performed to\r\n15 quantify the bond strength under combined compression and shear, and indirect tension. Test\r\n16 results demonstrated that under compressive loading (slant shear test), the bond strength is\r\n17 greater than the strength of the substrate, provided that a surface texture greater than the standard\r\n18 smooth finished mortar surface is used. For the bond strength under indirect tension (splitting\r\n19 prism test), results were not highly sensitive to the surface roughness. In both the cases, the\r\n20 measured bond strengths fall within the ranges specified in the ACI Guide for the Selection of\r\n21 Materials for the Repair of Concrete.'),

The\r\nrecent use of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) in the United\r\nStates for bridge applications has proved efficient and economical because\r\nof its superior structural and durability characteristics. On the basis of\r\nthe advantages of UHPC and precast systems, a design for a full-depth\r\nUHPC waffle deck panel system was developed. A full-scale, single-span,\r\n60-ft long by 33-ft wide prototype bridge with full-depth prefabricated\r\nUHPC waffle deck panels has been planned as a replacement bridge in\r\nWapello County, Iowa. In support of this project, structural performance\r\nand constructability of the UHPC waffle deck system and its critical\r\nconnections were studied through an experimental program at Iowa\r\nState University. Two prefabricated, full-depth, UHPC waffle deck\r\npanels were connected to two 24-ft long precast prestressed girders,\r\nand the system was tested under service, fatigue, and ultimate loads.\r\nOn the basis of the test observations and results and the experience\r\ngained from fabrication of deck panels and casting of UHPC infill joints\r\n(transverse and longitudinal), the prefabricated UHPC waffle deck\r\nsystem concept was found to be a viable option to achieve the goals of\r\nthe AASHTO strategic plan.');
